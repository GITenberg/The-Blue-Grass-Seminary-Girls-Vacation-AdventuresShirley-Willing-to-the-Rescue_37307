<h1>THE BLUE GRASS SEMINARY GIRLS’ VACATION ADVENTURES</h1>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_3'></a>3</span><a name='chI' id='chI'></a>CHAPTER I.—THE BROKEN DAM.</h2>
<p>
“The dam! The dam! The dam has broken!”
</p>
<p>
Shirley Willing, with flaming eyes and tightly-clenched
hands, jumped quickly forward, and with
her right hand seized the bridle of a horse that was
bearing a strange boy along the road, which ran
near the river.
</p>
<p>
The horse reared back on its haunches, frightened
at the sudden halting.
</p>
<p>
“The dam!” cried the young girl again.
“Quick! The people must be warned!”
</p>
<p>
The face of the rider turned white.
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?” he shouted, fear stamped
on every feature.
</p>
<p>
Shirley’s excitement fell from her like a cloak.
She became quiet.
</p>
<p>
“The Darret dam has been washed away,” she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_4'></a>4</span>
answered, “and unless the people in the valley are
warned immediately they will perish. There is
one chance to save them. You are mounted. You
can outrun the oncoming wall of water and save
them. Away with you, quick! There is not a
second to spare!”
</p>
<p>
“But,” protested the boy, “the water may overtake
me and I shall drown. We can climb to higher
ground here and be safe.”
</p>
<p>
He tried to turn his horse’s head to the east.
But Shirley clung to the rein.
</p>
<p>
“And leave those people to drown, without warning?”
she cried. “You coward! You are afraid!”
</p>
<p>
“I——” the boy began, but Shirley cut his protest
short.
</p>
<p>
Releasing the bridle of the horse, she sprang
quickly to the side of the animal, seized the rider
by the leg with both her strong, young hands and
pulled quickly and vigorously. Unprepared for
such action, the boy came tumbling to the ground
in a sprawling heap.
</p>
<p>
Quick as a flash Shirley leaped to the saddle and
turned the horse’s head toward the valley. As she
dug her heels into the animal’s ribs, sending him
forward with a jump, she called over her shoulder
to the boy, who sat still dazed at the sudden
danger:
</p>
<p>
“Get to safety the best way you can, you coward!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_5'></a>5</span>
</p>
<p>
Under the firm touch of the girl’s hand on the
rein the horse sped on down the valley.
</p>
<p>
It was a mad race with death and Shirley knew
it. But she realized that human lives were at stake
and she did not hesitate.
</p>
<p>
To the left of the road down which she sped lay
high ground and safety, while coming down the
valley, perhaps a mile in the rear, poured a dense
wall of water, coming as swift as the wind.
</p>
<p>
For days the Mississippi and its tributaries had
been rising rapidly and steadily. Along the lowlands
in that part of the state of Illinois, just
south of Cairo, where Shirley Willing had been
visiting friends, fears that the Darret dam, three
miles up one of these tributary streams, would give
way, had been entertained.
</p>
<p>
Some families, therefore, had moved their perishable
belongings to higher ground, where they
would be beyond the sweep of the waters should
the dam break.
</p>
<p>
Then suddenly, without warning, the dam had
gone.
</p>
<p>
The home where Shirley had been visiting was
a farmhouse, and the cry of danger had been received
by telephone. Those in the house had been
asked to repeat the warning to families further
down the valley. But the fierce wind that was raging
had, at almost that very moment, blown down
all wires.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_6'></a>6</span>
</p>
<p>
Shirley, in spite of the fact that she, with the
others, could easily have reached the safety afforded
by higher ground a short distance away, had
thought only of those whose lives would be snuffed
out if they were not warned.
</p>
<p>
She had decided that she would warn them herself.
She ran from the house to the stable, where
one single horse had been left.
</p>
<p>
But the seriousness of the situation seemed to
have been carried to the animal, and when Shirley
had attempted to slip a bridle over his head he
struck out violently with his fore feet. As the girl
sprang back, he dashed from the stable.
</p>
<p>
Shirley ran after him and followed him into the
road. There she encountered a rider; and the conversation
with which this story begins took place.
</p>
<p>
As the girl sped down the road, she could hear
from far behind, the roar of the waters as they came
tumbling after her.
</p>
<p>
A farmhouse came into sight. A man, a woman
and several children came out, attracted by the
galloping hoofbeats. Without checking the speed
of her mount a single instant, Shirley guided the
horse close to them.
</p>
<p>
“The dam! The dam!” she shouted, as she
flashed by.
</p>
<p>
No other words were necessary. Without stopping
to gather up any of their effects, they all turned
their faces and rushed for higher ground.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_7'></a>7</span>
</p>
<p>
A second, a third, and a fourth farmhouse came
into view, and as she flashed by, the girl hurled
her warning at each.
</p>
<p>
Half a mile below lay the little town of Stanley.
It was for this that Shirley was headed, in her race
with the rushing water.
</p>
<p>
The roar behind her became louder, and Shirley,
leaning over her horse’s neck, urged him to further
efforts with soft and coaxing words.
</p>
<p>
The noble animal, seeming to realize that he was
upon a message of life or death, responded, and it
seemed that he must have winged feet, so lightly
and swiftly did he fly over the ground.
</p>
<p>
But the roaring wall of water came closer.
</p>
<p>
Shirley uttered a cry of relief. Before her she
made out the first house in the little town. The
sounds of the clattering hoofs on the hard macadamized
road drew the residents from their homes.
Several had gathered in a little knot as Shirley
approached. Evidently they had not heard the
sound of the roaring waters.
</p>
<p>
“The dam has gone!” cried the girl, as she came
up to them, and rode by without checking the speed
of her horse. “<em>Fly</em> for your lives!”
</p>
<p>
Instantly all became bustle and confusion. The
word was passed like a flash and almost as one man
the town poured from its homes and dashed for
safety.
</p>
<p>
Clear through the town the young girl rode, calling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_8'></a>8</span>
out her warning. Then, and not until then, did
she check her horse and turn his head toward the
safety that lay in the east.
</p>
<p>
A man ran up to her.
</p>
<p>
“The Hendersons!” he cried. “They left here
not five minutes ago in their buggy. The water
will catch them on the road!”
</p>
<p>
Without a word, Shirley turned her horse and
would have dashed forward had not the man caught
the bridle.
</p>
<p>
“It’s death to you!” he cried.
</p>
<p>
“It’s death to them if I don’t make it!” cried
Shirley.
</p>
<p>
She dug her heels into the animal’s flanks and the
horse shook off the detaining hand with a quick
twitch of his head. Evidently he, as well as the
girl, realized his responsibility.
</p>
<p>
Once more, under the guiding hand, he dashed
forward as if it were wings that carried him so
lightly and swiftly over the ground. And as he
flew on, Shirley patted him softly on the neck and
spoke low words of encouragement.
</p>
<p>
The noble animal’s ears stood straight and there
was fire in his eyes. He seemed to say: “We will
save them if it is possible.”
</p>
<p>
Rounding a sudden turn in the road, Shirley
made out a buggy going leisurely along. At the
same moment the roar of the water came more
plainly to her ears.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_9'></a>9</span>
</p>
<p>
She raised her voice in a shout that rose above
the sound of roaring water behind—rose above the
sounds of clattering hoofs and above the voices
of the occupants of the buggy themselves.
</p>
<p>
The buggy stopped, the man’s face peered out.
As he saw Shirley dashing along the road after him,
a sudden understanding of what was wrong came
to him. Raising an arm, he waved it as a signal
that the girl’s warning had been understood, and
started his horse on a run.
</p>
<p>
Shirley breathed a great sigh of relief and dashed
on after the buggy, which was now going at terrific
speed, rocking crazily and threatening every
moment to turn over in the road.
</p>
<p>
Coming suddenly to an open field at the left side
of the road, the man sent the buggy dashing across
it, and made, as fast as his horse could go, for a
point where the ground rose sheer for perhaps a
hundred feet.
</p>
<p>
Shirley sped after the buggy.
</p>
<p>
Coming to this abrupt rise, they were forced to
search for a means of clambering up it. The
woman in the buggy, at the man’s command, sprang
from the seat and dashed hurriedly up the steep
hill. The man in the meantime stopped to unhitch
his horse, that the animal might have a chance for
its life.
</p>
<p>
Turning in her saddle, Shirley cried out in sudden
fear.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_10'></a>10</span>
</p>
<p>
Behind, so close that it seemed to be right upon
her and bearing down with tremendous speed, came
a solid wall of water, many feet high.
</p>
<p>
With a cry to her horse, the girl turned his head
squarely to the hill. With his nostrils extended
and his eyes dilated with fear, the animal sprang
at it. With his light burden he gained a foothold
and dashed up as fast as his weary limbs could
carry him. Once he came to a place that seemed
too much for him; but the noble steed made a last
desperate effort and succeeded in getting his forefeet
on top of the level ground above.
</p>
<p>
With a single movement, Shirley flung herself
from the saddle to the safety of the high ground,
and in another moment seized the bridle of the
horse, just as he would have slipped back into the
raging flood that now swept by below.
</p>
<p>
Exerting her utmost strength—and it was by no
means slight—she succeeded in helping the animal
to scramble to the summit.
</p>
<p>
The occupants of the buggy had also succeeded
in climbing to safety, but the second horse had
been carried away by the sweeping waters. Henderson
had been unable to loosen the animal, as he
was forced to hurry to the support of Mrs. Henderson,
who, almost in safety, had fainted and
would have fallen back, had her husband’s arm not
caught her.
</p>
<p>
From this refuge, the three watched the waters
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_11'></a>11</span>
as they swirled by with tremendous force. Kicking
animals, sheds, barns and small houses, together
with ruins and débris, swept past them, and more
than once the young girl cried out in despair, as she
realized the damage that had been done by the
water.
</p>
<p>
The three had climbed to the very top of the
hill, as the water surrounded them on all sides.
Gradually it rose, climbing closer and closer to them.
Shirley became alarmed and turned to Henderson,
who stood near her, still supporting his wife.
</p>
<p>
“Will it come this high, do you think, Mr. Henderson?”
</p>
<p>
Henderson shook his head.
</p>
<p>
“There is no telling,” he replied quietly. “All
we can do is to hope for the best.”
</p>
<p>
All became silent, but their eyes were riveted
upon the water as it closed in on them.
</p>
<p>
Now there was but perhaps twenty yards of dry
ground, then fifteen, and still the water rose. The
rise continued until all stood in water, and then it
rose no higher.
</p>
<p>
“Thank God!” said Henderson, calmly, looking
at his wife. “We are saved!”
</p>
<p>
“Thank God, indeed,” said Shirley softly, and she
turned and stroked the horse, who thrust his cold
muzzle into her hand. “But for you,” she added,
patting him gently, “hundreds would have been
drowned!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_12'></a>12</span><a name='chII' id='chII'></a>CHAPTER II.—A DARING ACT.</h2>
<p>
Night came on, and still the three—a man, a
woman and a young girl—stood ankle deep in the
cold water, which showed no sign of receding.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Henderson was completely worn out. At
Shirley’s suggestion, Henderson placed her upon
the back of the horse, where she was at least dry.
</p>
<p>
“There is no telling how long we may have to
remain here,” said Henderson. “The water may
not go down before morning.”
</p>
<p>
“But,” said Shirley, “we cannot remain here that
long. We must do something.”
</p>
<p>
“What?” asked Henderson briefly.
</p>
<p>
“Well, we might try shouting,” said Shirley.
“Some one might hear us.”
</p>
<p>
They both raised their voices to their loudest
and shouted long and often. But no reply came.
</p>
<p>
Shirley glanced carefully about her in the dim
light. They stood on the very top of the little
hill, and all about them was water. Perhaps a
quarter of a mile to the right, however, was another
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_13'></a>13</span>
elevation, and this Shirley knew was not
merely a similar hill, but high ground that ran back
for miles—the land upon which all those in the
flooded valley had sought safety.
</p>
<p>
“I have a plan,” she said quietly to Henderson.
</p>
<p>
“What is it?” he asked eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“It’s very simple,” was the reply. “I shall mount
the horse, and we shall try and swim through the
short expanse of water to the dry ground over
there,” and she pointed across the flood.
</p>
<p>
Henderson started back aghast at the boldness of
this plan. Beneath them the water still swished
angrily, although it had lost much of its force.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll not hear of it,” he said shortly. “You shall
not risk your life.”
</p>
<p>
“But,” protested the girl, “we are all likely to
become numbed and perish here.”
</p>
<p>
She shivered slightly as she spoke, for the night
air was damp, cold and penetrating.
</p>
<p>
“I think it is the best way,” she added quietly.
“Besides, what danger is there? Hero,” she named
the horse in that moment, “can make it all right.
All I shall have to do is cling to him tightly.”
</p>
<p>
“But the current may be very strong,” protested
Henderson.
</p>
<p>
“Not too strong for us, is it, Hero?” she asked
the horse, and patted him gently again.
</p>
<p>
Hero whinnied in reply, and seemed as eager
as the girl to make the trial. He seemed to understand
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_14'></a>14</span>
the conversation, and besides, he was
anxious to reach a place where there was warmth,
dry straw and good oats.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, it is the best way,” said Shirley decisively.
</p>
<p>
Henderson looked at her closely, then turned
away with a sigh, for that one glance was enough
to tell him that the young girl would have her way.
</p>
<p>
He lifted his wife from Hero’s back, and Shirley
immediately climbed into the saddle.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll send a boat for you,” Shirley called over
her shoulder, as, with a tug of the reins, she headed
Hero into the water.
</p>
<p>
“Good luck!” called Henderson. “Keep your
head, and hold tight. Don’t be swept off the horse’s
back.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley did not reply, but kept her eyes straight
ahead.
</p>
<p>
Gradually Hero sank lower and lower into the
water, and then went under suddenly. His feet no
longer touched the bottom.
</p>
<p>
Henderson and his wife cried out in alarm as
horse and girl sank beneath the water; but they
rose again in a moment, and, shaking the water
from his eyes with an angry snort, Hero struck out
boldly for the distant shore.
</p>
<p>
The current was still strong and gradually bore
them down the valley. But Hero made headway,
and every stroke of his mighty legs bore them much
nearer safety.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_15'></a>15</span>
</p>
<p>
Now darkness, thick and intense, descended over
the valley, and neither horse nor rider could see
five yards ahead. But neither lost heart, Hero
plunging straight ahead and Shirley clinging
tightly to his neck and uttering low words of encouragement.
</p>
<p>
For a long, long time, as it seemed to both horse
and rider, they continued their cold and wet journey;
then, abruptly, Hero’s feet struck the rising
ground of the high land. A moment later he stood
on all feet, the water up to his knees, but with solid
ground beneath him. Quickly he drew himself free
of the water, and Shirley, soaking wet, and cramped
from the one position she had been forced to maintain,
jumped stiffly to the ground.
</p>
<p>
She threw her arms around the horse’s neck, and
gave him a great hug.
</p>
<p>
“Good old Hero!” she exclaimed. “I knew you
would bring us over safely. Now to find some
one and send them after the Hendersons.”
</p>
<p>
She walked quickly along in the darkness, Hero
following her like a dog.
</p>
<p>
At last, in the distance, she made out a dim light
and hurried on toward it. Soon she was close
enough to make out that she was approaching a
little house, through a window of which the light
twinkled. She broke into a run, and without stopping
to knock, dashed inside.
</p>
<p>
A man and a woman rose to their feet, and Shirley
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_16'></a>16</span>
was also conscious of other figures in the room.
</p>
<p>
A pain shot through her head, she reeled dizzily
and toppled over in a dead faint; but before she
lost consciousness she heard a voice that sounded
many miles away exclaim:
</p>
<p>
“Why, Shirley Willing! What are you doing
here, and in this condition?”
</p>
<p>
When Shirley recovered consciousness she lay
upon a little bed, and several figures were bending
over her. One she recognized in a moment, and
addressed it in a low voice and with a smile on her
face.
</p>
<p>
“Mabel!” she exclaimed. “Where am I and what
is the matter with me?”
</p>
<p>
But before the other could reply, the thrilling
experience she had been through came back to her
like a flash; and springing from the bed, unmindful
of the sharp pain that shot through her head, she
exclaimed:
</p>
<p>
“The Hendersons! Quick! Have you a boat?”
</p>
<p>
“There, there,” said the girl whom she had addressed
as Mabel. “You are a little overwrought.
Lie down again, dearie.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley shook off the other’s hand.
</p>
<p>
“The Hendersons,” she explained, “are marooned
on a little hill in the midst of the raging flood.
They must be helped quickly. Mrs. Henderson is
ill and unless she is given shelter at once may die
from exposure.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_17'></a>17</span>
</p>
<p>
Immediately all in the room began to ask questions,
but Shirley, raising a hand, stopped them.
Then, briefly, she explained the situation.
</p>
<p>
The men in the room leaped to their feet and
dashed out of the house. Shirley ran after them.
</p>
<p>
“You may not be able to find the place in the
dark,” she said, “but I think I can show you the
way. My sense of direction has always been good.”
</p>
<p>
In spite of the protests of the others, she went
with the men while they hauled a large rowboat out
of a nearby shed and dragged it to the water’s
edge.
</p>
<p>
Here, launching it, they all climbed in. Shirley
would have followed, but one man objected.
</p>
<p>
“You are worn out now,” he said. “You had
better get to bed.”
</p>
<p>
But Shirley was not to be denied.
</p>
<p>
“This is my adventure,” she said warmly, “and
besides, I can probably help you locate the Hendersons.
My eyes are unusually sharp.”
</p>
<p>
She stepped into the boat in spite of all protests,
and soon, under the strong arms of the men, the
little craft leaped out over the water.
</p>
<p>
It was pitch dark, and almost impossible for the
occupants of the boat to see their hands before
them. A lantern in the prow of the boat only
seemed to make the darkness more intense.
</p>
<p>
After half an hour’s rowing the men rested on
their oars and listened. There was no sound. They
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_18'></a>18</span>
rowed for perhaps another quarter of an hour, and
again paused to listen. Just as they were about to
go on again, Shirley’s ears caught the sound of a
distant hail.
</p>
<p>
“Listen!” she cried, and all sat silently.
</p>
<p>
The hail came again, but at first those in the boat
were unable to tell from what direction. They
listened and it came again.
</p>
<p>
“Back and to the right,” said Shirley. “We must
have passed them in the darkness.”
</p>
<p>
The boat was brought about and headed in the
direction Shirley indicated; and still there was no
sign of the Hendersons. But the next hail was
clearer, and much closer.
</p>
<p>
“Come straight ahead!” came the cry over the
flood.
</p>
<p>
The rowers now followed the directions shouted
across the water, and after what seemed a very
long time, made out, directly ahead, the figure of a
man and a woman, huddled close together to keep
warm. It was Henderson and his wife.
</p>
<p>
Once inside the boat, Mrs. Henderson promptly
fainted. Shirley lifted the unconscious woman’s
head into her lap and bathed her face with water,
and she soon revived.
</p>
<p>
The boat made rapid progress on the return
journey and soon all were in the warm enclosure
of the little house. Mrs. Henderson was promptly
put to bed, but Shirley had something else to do.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_19'></a>19</span>
</p>
<p>
Calling one of the men to follow her, she left
the house and, after some searching, came upon
what she sought.
</p>
<p>
This was Hero standing at the door of the little
stable, nosing it and trying his best to get in. Shirley
turned to her companions.
</p>
<p>
“This,” she said, stroking the animal’s wet mane,
“is the one you all have to thank for your
escape from the flood. Had it not been for Hero,
I would have been unable to give the warning, and
now it seems to me he is entitled to a nice warm
stall and some nice fresh oats. Would you like
them, Hero?”
</p>
<p>
The horse whinnied in joy, and one of the men
said:
</p>
<p>
“He certainly shall have both.”
</p>
<p>
He approached and took the animal by the bridle,
but Hero drew back.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe you can lead him,” said the man. “He
won’t come for me.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley laughed. “Come, Hero!” she called and
without leading he followed her into the stable,
where he was escorted to a clean stall.
</p>
<p>
“And now you go to bed,” said one of the men
to Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll stay and see him fed first,” replied the girl.
</p>
<p>
“All right, have your own way!”
</p>
<p>
He produced the oats, and soon Hero was nosing
and eating them contentedly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_20'></a>20</span>
</p>
<p>
Then, and not until then, did Shirley return to
the house. Throwing off her wet garments, she
crept into bed when, tired and worn out, she closed
her eyes and slept.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_21'></a>21</span><a name='chIII' id='chIII'></a>CHAPTER III.—THE BLUE GRASS SEMINARY.</h2>
<p>
Shirley Willing was a typical product of the
little town of Paris, Bourbon County, Kentucky; and
at the time this story opens had just passed her fifteenth
year. She was the one child of Christopher
Willing, a prosperous farmer and horseman, who
owned an extensive place on the Bethlehem pike
some three or four miles from the little city.
</p>
<p>
Being an only daughter, she was naturally somewhat
spoiled, although she and her father would
have resented such an implication. Nevertheless,
spoiled she was, as all were aware except these two.
Shirley was slight and slender, with a wealth of
auburn hair and cheeks like roses. All her life she
had been athletically inclined, and for the past two
years—ever since she had been attending the Blue
Grass Seminary—she had indulged in outdoor
sports continually.
</p>
<p>
The Blue Grass Seminary was one of those
schools in which the chief object was to produce
not only cultured and educated young women, but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_22'></a>22</span>
physically perfect ones as well. While the course
of study was on a par with all first-class schools,
the management did not believe that the students
should spend all their time over their books.
</p>
<p>
“Give the girls a practical education,” was the
theory of the principal, and both he and his assistants
endeavored in every way to enable the girls
under their care to practice in the open the theories
taught in the schoolroom.
</p>
<p>
Much time was also devoted to athletics in the
Blue Grass Seminary, but there were no hard and
fast rules as to what branch of athletics each pupil
should take up. Shirley Willing’s great hobby and
chief diversion was horseback riding. She was
an expert horse-woman at fifteen and could ride
anything, as she had proved more than once.
</p>
<p>
Besides having a well-kept farm, Mr. Willing
also owned a good “string” of blooded race horses,
and there was no novelty in one of them being
winner in many exciting races. It was this kind
of horse that Shirley most enjoyed riding.
</p>
<p>
Shirley’s particular chum and bosom friend was
Mabel Ashton, likewise the daughter of a prosperous
Kentuckian. Colonel Ashton was easily the
most prominent man in many respects in Bourbon
County. Mabel, who was a few months older than
Shirley, was equally well known among the younger
set. The girls had been friends almost since they
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_23'></a>23</span>
were babies, which was only natural because of the
close relationship between their families.
</p>
<p>
Another bond of sympathy between the girls was
that both had lost their mothers when a few months
old.
</p>
<p>
When Shirley made up her mind that she would
attend the Blue Grass Seminary—located in a
neighboring town some twenty miles away—there
was nothing more natural than that Mabel should
decide to go also. At first their fathers both opposed
the plan, but after Mr. Willing and Colonel
Ashton had spent a day at the Seminary and had
seen what an excellent school it was, they were
quite willing to let the girls attend.
</p>
<p>
At the Seminary the girls had been roommates.
Their closest friend was Lois Geddis, the daughter
of an Illinois farmer. Several times she had gone
home with Shirley to spend Sunday and had likewise
spent her Christmas vacation in Paris, upon
the promise that the two girls should visit her during
the summer. Thus it was that we find these
three Blue Grass Seminary girls in such close proximity
to the great Father of Waters.
</p>
<p>
The Kentucky girls had been visiting in Illinois
some two weeks when this story opens, and it was
now the latter part of June. They had only intended
to remain a week, but they had been having such
a good time that they had overstayed the stated
period. Finally they had selected a date upon
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_24'></a>24</span>
which they should return and in spite of all influence
that could be brought to bear, they were not
to be shaken in their purpose.
</p>
<p>
Then the flood came.
</p>
<p>
To account for Mabel’s presence in the little house
in which Shirley is now sleeping, it is necessary
to go back a little in our story.
</p>
<p>
It was about the time that the girls had set a
date to go home that heavy rains set in. The
summer had been dry so far and the rain was very
welcome. But for days, now, the downpour had
continued without any sign of abating. From further
up the river news was received of still heavier
rain, and these added to the regular June rise from
the Missouri caused the Mississippi at Cairo to
spread until it threatened to leave its bank.
</p>
<p>
A short distance above the home of Mr. Geddis,
where the girls were visiting, was a small tributary
of the Mississippi on which was built a great
dam, forming an immense reservoir. This was
known as the Darret dam. At this point also, the
river broadened into what seemed almost a small
bay in which the water was very deep, so that
the volume back of the dam was something enormous.
</p>
<p>
When it became apparent that there was to be
no let-up in the steady rains, and as the waters of
the Mississippi continued to rise, Mr. Geddis, as
well as other farmers in the vicinity, moved all their
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_25'></a>25</span>
livestock and household effects to higher ground
that they might be safe should the dam give way;
for it was a well-known fact that if the dam burst,
the valley would be flooded and everything carried
away.
</p>
<p>
Guards were posted near the dam to give the
warning, should it threaten to burst. Vigil was
kept day and night, while the residents of the countryside
were prepared to flee at the first warning of
imminent disaster.
</p>
<p>
But the dam had finally burst so suddenly that
the warning came almost too late. Shirley, Mabel,
Lois, her father and mother were at supper when
the telephone jangled furiously. Lois, who was
nearest, quickly put the receiver to her ear, and
then turned to the others with a cry:
</p>
<p>
“The dam is gone!”
</p>
<p>
Then it was that those in the farmhouse attempted
to repeat the warning down the valley,
and it was discovered that the wires were down.
As has been told, it was then that Shirley made her
wild dash, that might have resulted fatally.
</p>
<p>
When Shirley had disappeared, the others, after
seeking in vain for her, had finally given it up as
hopeless.
</p>
<p>
“She is probably safe some place,” said Mr.
Geddis. “Come, we must hurry.”
</p>
<p>
They started for the highlands, which they
reached safely, and from there watched the mountains
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_26'></a>26</span>
of water as they swept down, flooding the
valley.
</p>
<p>
“I believe I know what has happened to Shirley,”
said Mabel quietly.
</p>
<p>
“What?” asked Lois, eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“I believe she went down the valley to warn the
people.”
</p>
<p>
Lois gave a startled cry.
</p>
<p>
“She will be drowned!” she cried.
</p>
<p>
“I’m not sure about that,” said Mabel quietly.
“You see, I know Shirley a little better than you
do. If there is one way by which she can reach
safety, Shirley is sure to find it.”
</p>
<p>
“I do hope she will not be harmed,” said Lois,
beginning to cry.
</p>
<p>
Refugees fled to the highlands in droves, leaving
everything behind. Mr. Geddis and his party
advanced, just on the edge of the high ground,
down the valley. Here they came upon others who
had been forced to flee for safety.
</p>
<p>
“How did the warning reach you?” asked Mr.
Geddis of one of the men.
</p>
<p>
“Girl on horseback,” was the reply. “She came
dashing down the road like wind. If it hadn’t been
for her, hundreds would have perished.”
</p>
<p>
Mabel, who overheard this conversation, cried
out in alarm:
</p>
<p>
“Where is she?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_27'></a>27</span>
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” was the reply. “She was headed
straight for the village.”
</p>
<p>
Mabel seized Lois by the arm.
</p>
<p>
“Come,” she cried, “let’s go farther. Perhaps
we can find Shirley.”
</p>
<p>
With a word to her father, Lois followed her
friend. They came, at last, to a part of the ground
directly behind the little village of Stanley, now
lying beneath the water. Here they plied the refugees
with question after question, and finally came
upon the man who had seen the girl wheel her horse
and dash down the road after the Hendersons.
</p>
<p>
“There is not one chance in a thousand that she
escaped,” he said slowly; “nor the Hendersons,
either, for that matter.”
</p>
<p>
The girls left him and continued on down the
course of the raging water, for they believed that
Shirley might possibly have reached safety in that
direction.
</p>
<p>
It grew dusk, and still they walked on, scanning
the nearby waters and the ground closely. Night
fell.
</p>
<p>
“Well, we might as well go back,” said Mabel
quietly. “I am afraid we shall never see her again.”
</p>
<p>
“I know we won’t,” said Lois, and fell to weeping.
</p>
<p>
“Come, come,” said Mabel, throwing her arm
about her friend’s shoulders. “Crying will do no
good.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_28'></a>28</span>
</p>
<p>
“But—but,” sobbed Lois, “if it hadn’t been for
me she would be alive.”
</p>
<p>
“How do you make that out?” asked Mabel, in
some surprise.
</p>
<p>
“Why, she would not have come to this part of
the country.”
</p>
<p>
“Never mind,” said Mabel. “Shirley wouldn’t
want you to feel badly about it. I know that.”
</p>
<p>
They turned and began to retrace their steps.
It was then that Lois made a startling discovery.
They had unconsciously walked further and further
away from the water’s edge, in among a grove of
trees.
</p>
<p>
“We are lost!” cried Lois.
</p>
<p>
“Lost!” echoed Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. I don’t know where we are. I have never
been in these woods before.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I guess we’ll get out all right,” said Mabel
confidently.
</p>
<p>
She moved forward, but in the darkness she had
no means of telling whether she was going in the
right direction. The girls walked quickly this way
and that, but they could find no exit from the
grove of trees.
</p>
<p>
Mabel raised her young voice in a cry for help,
and Lois added hers to it.
</p>
<p>
From the distance came a faint response.
</p>
<p>
Encouraged, the girls renewed their efforts, and
keeping it up, were finally rewarded by the sounds
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_29'></a>29</span>
of footsteps coming toward them. A moment later
the figure of a man appeared before them.
</p>
<p>
“What on earth are you two girls doing here?”
he asked in amazement.
</p>
<p>
“We are lost,” stammered Lois, beginning to cry
again, now that she felt she was safe once more.
</p>
<p>
“Who are you?” asked the man.
</p>
<p>
The girls told him.
</p>
<p>
“And we want to get back to father,” moaned
Lois.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said the man, “you can’t get back to-night.
You have come farther than you realize.
My name is Thompson, and I have a shack nearby.
You shall both spend the night with us. Mrs.
Thompson will make you at home.”
</p>
<p>
In spite of repeated requests by both girls that
they be set on the road home and assurances that
they were not afraid to go alone, Thompson shook
his head negatively.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll do as I say,” he said. “I wouldn’t allow
a daughter of mine to go prowling through the
woods at this time of night. Come with me.”
</p>
<p>
The girls were forced to obey, for they had no
desire to be left in the woods alone.
</p>
<p>
Mrs. Thompson made the girls comfortable, and
showed them a bed in a room at the rear of the
house, on the ground floor.
</p>
<p>
It was while they were sitting talking, that they
became aware of clattering of hoofs. A moment
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_30'></a>30</span>
later the door flew open and Shirley staggered into
the room. Both girls were on their feet in an instant.
</p>
<p>
“Shirley!” they cried, and rushed forward.
</p>
<p>
It was then that Shirley had fainted.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_31'></a>31</span><a name='chIV' id='chIV'></a>CHAPTER IV.—A RAILROAD ACCIDENT.</h2>
<p>
“How long are we likely to be delayed, conductor?”
</p>
<p>
The speaker was Shirley, and the date was one
week from the day on which the girl, by her daring
ride, had saved scores in the Illinois town and
in the valley from perishing in the flood.
</p>
<p>
Shirley and her friend Mabel had left their chum’s
home the day before. In the morning they caught
a train out of St. Louis, and now, in the afternoon,
they had learned that their train would be held
indefinitely in Indianapolis because of a serious
wreck ahead.
</p>
<p>
“There is no telling, miss,” was the conductor’s
answer to Shirley’s question. “The wreck is a
bad one, and it is impossible to say just when the
track will be cleared. If we wait for that, it is likely
to be hours. We may, however, be routed over
some other line. I shall know within a quarter of
an hour.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you,” replied Shirley, and the two girls
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_32'></a>32</span>
continued to pace up and down alongside their car.
</p>
<p>
Half an hour later the conductor approached
them.
</p>
<p>
“The wreck is more serious than at first reported,”
he said, “and because of some unknown
reason we cannot be routed over another line.
Therefore, it will be at least six hours before we
will leave.”
</p>
<p>
“My gracious,” said Shirley, “we can make better
time than that by taking the Interurban.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said the conductor, “and in that way you
can reach Cincinnati in time to catch the 6 o’clock
L. &amp; N., which will put you in Paris at ten. If
you wait for us you will have to remain all night
in Cincinnati.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley turned to Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Let’s get our things and hurry and catch the
trolley car,” she said.
</p>
<p>
The two girls boarded the delayed train and
hastily collected their belongings. The conductor
was courteous enough to see them to a taxicab,
which soon whirled them across the city. Here they
found that they could get an electric car in fifteen
minutes, which, barring accidents, would get them
in Cincinnati in ample time for the six o’clock train
south.
</p>
<p>
The girls climbed aboard the car, settled themselves
comfortably, and fell to talking. At last
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_33'></a>33</span>
the car started, and soon they were beyond the
city and whirling along rapidly.
</p>
<p>
For an hour they rode, the car stopping occasionally
to take on or to discharge passengers; and
then, suddenly, slackening slightly to round rather
a sharp curve, the car dashed forward again; and
there came a sharp cry from passengers in the front
seats.
</p>
<p>
At the same instant the motorman reversed his
power, and there was a terrific jolt. Prompt as the
motorman’s action had been it had not been prompt
enough.
</p>
<p>
A terrible shock followed as the car dashed into
another coming along the single track from the opposite
direction. There was a crash of splintering
wood and then cries of pain and terror from the
passengers.
</p>
<p>
The first outcry had told all on the car that a
disaster was about to occur, and the passengers had
sprung to their feet even before the crash—all but
Mabel and Shirley.
</p>
<p>
Glancing quickly out the window, Mabel had perceived
the other car bearing down on them, and
started to rise. But Shirley saw it at the same
moment, and throwing out her hand quickly, she
grasped her friend by the arm and pulled her back
into her seat.
</p>
<p>
“Sit still!” she commanded.
</p>
<p>
When the shock came, Shirley, sitting next to the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_34'></a>34</span>
window, was hurled back over her seat with terrible
force, while broken glass was showered upon
her. Then, as the car crumpled, in some unaccountable
manner both girls were hurled through
the air some distance away, where they both lay
for a moment, stunned.
</p>
<p>
Shirley was the first to come to herself, and
her thought was of her friend. Although she reeled
dizzily, she succeeded in pulling herself (unconsciously)
to her feet, and at a first glance about her
saw Mabel lying near. Shirley staggered to the
side of her chum and bent down.
</p>
<p>
She raised the girl’s head to her knee and rubbed
the cold face with her hand.
</p>
<p>
“Mabel! Mabel!” she called anxiously.
</p>
<p>
There was no reply, and again Shirley gave her
attention to trying to revive her friend. At last
her efforts were rewarded.
</p>
<p>
Mabel’s head moved slightly, and Shirley, bending
closer, saw a faint color come into her face. At
last she opened her eyes, and said feebly:
</p>
<p>
“What is it? What has happened?”
</p>
<p>
“Wreck,” was the brief reply, “and we are both
lucky not to have been killed. How do you feel?
Where are you hurt?”
</p>
<p>
“I feel a little dizzy,” said Mabel, making an attempt
to get to her feet, but falling back. “I
don’t believe I am hurt very much, though.”
</p>
<p>
A second time she tried to get to her feet and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_35'></a>35</span>
this time she succeeded. She took one look at
Shirley’s face and then seized her friend in her
arms.
</p>
<p>
“Shirley!” she exclaimed. “Why didn’t you tell
me you were hurt?”
</p>
<p>
“Hurt?” repeated Shirley, starting back.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, your face is covered with blood.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley passed her hand over her face and it came
away red.
</p>
<p>
“I—I—didn’t know I was hurt,” she said in surprise.
</p>
<p>
Looking about, Mabel saw a pool of water nearby.
Quickly she ran to it and wet her handkerchief.
Then she ran back and proceeded to wash her
friend’s face.
</p>
<p>
“It’s not bad,” she said, after an examination.
“Looks like a piece of glass had cut you. It’s
stopped bleeding, though.”
</p>
<p>
“Good,” laughed Shirley, and would have said
more, but that her attention was attracted by a
shout from behind.
</p>
<p>
Turning, she beheld a terrible sight.
</p>
<p>
There, not twenty yards away, in a tangled heap,
lay the two cars, and even as Shirley turned a small
tongue of flame crept from the wreckage.
</p>
<p>
“Fire!” cried Shirley and, turning quickly, she
ran toward the cars. Mabel followed her.
</p>
<p>
Beside the cars men were rushing hurriedly
about, grim-faced and silent.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_36'></a>36</span>
</p>
<p>
“Half a dozen women are pinioned beneath the
wreck,” replied one man briefly to Shirley’s questioning.
</p>
<p>
Shirley shuddered, as did Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Horrible,” said the latter.
</p>
<p>
The girls drew closer; then stopped to watch
the work of rescue.
</p>
<p>
The flame had now grown from the size of a
man’s hand to something large, and it was plain
even to the girls’ inexperienced eyes that it was only
a question of minutes until those buried beneath
the wreckage would be burned alive, did not help
come at once.
</p>
<p>
A sudden cry of anguish came not twenty feet
from where the girls stood and, glancing in the
direction of the cry, Shirley beheld the head of a
little girl of perhaps ten years protruding from beneath
the débris.
</p>
<p>
“Poor thing,” she cried, and dashed forward.
</p>
<p>
Mabel followed.
</p>
<p>
In vain did the tot struggle to extricate herself
from beneath the wreckage. Crying and screaming,
she continued her futile efforts.
</p>
<p>
At sight of the two girls dashing toward her she
cried even more piteously than before.
</p>
<p>
Shirley caught hold of one arm that was extended,
and pulled. Again and again she tried, but
in vain; and the harder she pulled the harder the
child cried.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_37'></a>37</span>
</p>
<p>
Mabel stooped close and made an examination.
</p>
<p>
“There seems to be a wheel on her foot,” she
said, “and she is not strong enough to pull herself
from under it.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley let loose of the tot’s arm, and stooped
over the child. Then she rose swiftly, determination
written upon her face.
</p>
<p>
“You pull the child by the arm when I say,
‘Ready!’” she called.
</p>
<p>
“What are you going to do?” asked Mabel anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“Never mind,” was the reply. “Just do as I say,
and hurry.”
</p>
<p>
Mabel said no more but, according to Shirley’s
instructions, took the little one by the arm and stood
ready to pull when Shirley gave the word.
</p>
<p>
Stooping so that her head was under the edge of
the wreck, Shirley poked forth a dainty foot and by
burrowing a bit with her toe, at last found the child’s
foot beneath the wheel. Then, leaning forward and
straining every muscle of arms and limbs, the heavy
iron wheel was raised from the ground.
</p>
<p>
“Ready!” she called to Mabel.
</p>
<p>
Mabel pulled, and the little girl, still crying and
screaming, came from under the wreck.
</p>
<p>
But the strain upon Shirley had been terrible, and
no sooner had the child been dragged to safety, than
Shirley’s strength gave out, and the wheel settled
down upon her own foot.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_38'></a>38</span>
</p>
<p>
She did not cry out, but Mabel’s quick eyes detected
her friend’s plight. She uttered an exclamation
of dismay and hurried to her aid.
</p>
<p>
“Shirley!” was all she could say.
</p>
<p>
With her foot pinned beneath the wheel, Shirley
smiled at her.
</p>
<p>
“I’m caught,” she said simply. “How is the little
girl?”
</p>
<p>
Mabel bent over, and examined her chum’s predicament.
Then she laid hold of the wheel and attempted
to lift it.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t move it,” she said, and continued to tug
desperately at the wheel and heavy axle.
</p>
<p>
“You had better call some one to help you,” said
Shirley calmly.
</p>
<p>
Mabel gave up her attempt to lift the wheel and
hurried to the opposite side of the tangled wreckage,
where she could hear men at work trying to
pull other victims from beneath the heap.
</p>
<p>
The heat from the flames that now almost enveloped
the wreck was becoming more intense. It
was almost unbearable, and Shirley, imprisoned as
she was, stretched as far as possible from the fire.
</p>
<p>
At Mabel’s call for aid, one of the men gave
up his position with the others and followed her to
where Shirley lay. It was but the work of a moment
for him to lift the wheel sufficiently for Mabel
to help Shirley from beneath it.
</p>
<p>
Shirley arose and tried her foot. It pained her,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_39'></a>39</span>
but hasty examination showed that it was simply
bruised. Painfully, assisted by Mabel, she limped
after the man, who had raised the wheel, to the
opposite side of the wreck, where rescuers were
even at that moment pulling the last of the victims
from under the cars, away from the tongues of
flame.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_40'></a>40</span><a name='chV' id='chV'></a>CHAPTER V.—HOME AGAIN.</h2>
<p>
As she walked along, the pain in Shirley’s foot
became less and less, until finally she was not conscious
of it. The girls soon sat down upon the
grass, where they watched the men fighting the
flames, that the cars might not be entirely consumed.
</p>
<p>
Shirley suddenly jumped to her feet.
</p>
<p>
“Where is the girl we pulled from under the
car?” she asked Mabel.
</p>
<p>
Mabel also sprung up.
</p>
<p>
“I had forgotten all about her,” she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
They walked to where the little one lay, still
moaning with pain. Shirley picked her up gently,
and bade Mabel bring some water. This the latter
did, and the two girls at length succeeded in soothing
the child, until she lay still in Shirley’s arms.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly there was a fluttering of skirts, a glad
cry in a woman’s voice and the tot was snatched
from Shirley’s arms.
</p>
<p>
“Agnes, Agnes!” said the voice.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_41'></a>41</span>
</p>
<p>
Shirley arose and faced the woman who had taken
the child from her.
</p>
<p>
“I am Mrs. Johnson,” the woman said, “and this
is my daughter Agnes. The men told me you saved
her from the flames. I don’t know how to thank
you.”
</p>
<p>
“Never mind the thanks,” said Shirley. “We
simply pulled her away. That is all.”
</p>
<p>
“Why, Shirley,” exclaimed Mabel, “you almost
lost your own life.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley frowned at her friend.
</p>
<p>
“It was nothing,” she said.
</p>
<p>
The little girl’s mother looked first at one and
then at the other.
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t know you endangered your own life,”
she said. “I wish I could thank you properly.”
</p>
<p>
“Just say no more about it then,” said Shirley,
somewhat embarrassed by this conversation.
</p>
<p>
The woman smiled.
</p>
<p>
“As modest as you are brave,” she said. “Well,
then, I shall say no more about it. But remember,
if you ever need a friend, just call on me.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you. I shall remember,” said Shirley,
and the woman walked away, carrying her daughter
in her arms.
</p>
<p>
From down the track at this moment came the
buzz of an approaching car. It was the wrecking
train bringing a crew to clear the track, also physicians
and nurses.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_42'></a>42</span>
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, the services of none of the latter
were needed, for it was found, that besides the little
girl Shirley had rescued, none of the passengers had
been severely injured.
</p>
<p>
Half an hour later a car approached from the
other direction, and came to a stop a few yards from
the scene of the wreck. Passengers disembarked
and, upon the instructions of an official, the car
made ready to return toward Cincinnati.
</p>
<p>
Shirley and Mabel climbed aboard with the other
passengers and soon were on their way once more.
They did not wait to find their hand baggage, nor
did any of the other passengers. It was hopelessly
lost in the wreckage. Their trunks, they knew,
would reach Cincinnati, and eventually home, without
trouble.
</p>
<p>
The wreck had delayed the car for nearly two
hours; so when they finally reached Cincinnati, it
was too late to catch their train to Paris.
</p>
<p>
Shirley and Mabel had been in the Ohio city too
many times to feel frightened, however. So, after
sending a telegram to Mr. Willing explaining their
reasons for not being home on time, the two girls
made their way from the station to the Sinton
Hotel, where they spent the night.
</p>
<p>
They were up bright and early the next morning,
and caught their train soon after eight o’clock.
Shortly before eleven they reached Paris.
</p>
<p>
Shirley, the first to descend the steps, was caught
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_43'></a>43</span>
in the arms of a dignified, white-haired old gentleman,
who squeezed her until she cried out:
</p>
<p>
“Stop, Dad, or you will squeeze the life out of
me.”
</p>
<p>
The old gentleman laughed and, putting a hand
on both of her shoulders, held her off at arms’
length and looked at her intently.
</p>
<p>
“Well, well,” he said, “so I have you back again.
How glad I am to see you, daughter. It seems as
though you had been gone ten years.”
</p>
<p>
Again he regarded her earnestly.
</p>
<p>
“Come, Dad,” said Shirley, “you are blocking
the way. The people want to get off.”
</p>
<p>
“I’d like to know,” said Mr. Willing, looking
about fiercely, “who is going to tell me to move.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll tell you, Dad,” replied Shirley, smiling.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, well,” said her father, “that is a different
matter. You and your mother are alike, both
tyrants.”
</p>
<p>
He stepped aside, and thus allowed the first of
the passengers who had been held back by this
conversation to descend; and as the next one was
Mabel, he caught her in his arms and held her
also for a moment.
</p>
<p>
“Where is father?” asked Mabel gently, freeing
herself from the elderly man’s caresses.
</p>
<p>
“He’s waiting at home for you,” replied Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“Why didn’t he come to meet me?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_44'></a>44</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Mr. Willing, “I reckon he wasn’t
feeling quite as well as he might, so he asked me
to do the honors.”
</p>
<p>
“Is he sick?” asked Mabel anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“I reckon you might call it sick.”
</p>
<p>
“How sick?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, now, he’s not so sick; but if he pays much
attention to some of these doctors he soon will be.”
</p>
<p>
Mabel was growing more and more anxious.
</p>
<p>
“Do let us hurry and get home,” she said.
</p>
<p>
“Now, now, dear, don’t excite yourself,” said
Mr. Willing. “I reckon he will soon be all right
again.”
</p>
<p>
On the opposite side of the station a large touring
car waited. Mr. Willing pushed the two girls
into the back seat and then took his place by the
negro chauffeur.
</p>
<p>
“Home, Frank,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Yessah,” replied the old darky, and started the
car on its way.
</p>
<p>
Mabel leaned forward and spoke to Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“You will take me home first, won’t you?” she
asked.
</p>
<p>
“Your father,” was the reply, “has been staying
with me for the last week. He is there now.
You see, he was kind o’ lonely without his girl, so
I just had him come to me.”
</p>
<p>
The automobile quickly covered the three miles
to the Willing farm, and stopped before a broad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_45'></a>45</span>
wooden gate. This opened upon a broad blue-grass
field on which a fine herd of cattle were grazing.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll open the first,” called Shirley, and jumped
out of the car.
</p>
<p>
She threw it wide, and the car passed through.
Mabel opened the second one into the paddock, and
Shirley the third.
</p>
<p>
“There,” she said, when she was back in the car
rolling through the long yard. “I’m always glad
when that is done, although I don’t believe I mind
opening gates now.”
</p>
<p>
“Nor I,” said Mabel. “I remember that is one
reason I hated to come here sometimes, there were
so many gates to open.”
</p>
<p>
“The older you get,” said Mr. Willing, who had
overheard this conversation, “the less you will mind
a little work.”
</p>
<p>
The car now drew up before a big red brick house,
surrounded by many shade trees. The two girls
jumped out lightly, and Mr. Willing followed
slowly.
</p>
<p>
Mabel needed no directions as to where to find
her father and, running into the house, she ran up
the stairs and into the front bedroom.
</p>
<p>
She opened the door with a quick jerk, and
then paused. The quiet figure in the bed caught
her eye. It was her father, and he was sleeping.
</p>
<p>
Mabel tip-toed toward the bed, and bent over.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_46'></a>46</span>
Her father’s face was pale, but he seemed to be
resting easily.
</p>
<p>
“Poor father,” said Mabel. “I won’t disturb
him now.”
</p>
<p>
She turned and made her way toward the door.
As she laid her hand upon the knob and was about
to turn it, a voice called:
</p>
<p>
“Mabel!”
</p>
<p>
The girl turned. Her father was sitting up.
</p>
<p>
“Mabel!” he called again. Gladly the girl ran
to him and was at once clasped in his arms.
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t want to wake you,” she said.
</p>
<p>
“You know very well,” was the reply, “that, after
such a long absence, your very presence was bound
to awaken me. I was asleep, but I must have felt
that you had returned.”
</p>
<p>
Mabel sat down on the edge of the bed.
</p>
<p>
“Now tell me all about yourself,” she said.
“How long have you been sick?”
</p>
<p>
“About a month,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
“Why didn’t you write and tell me about it?”
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t want to spoil your vacation.”
</p>
<p>
“The idea! I would have come home at once to
care for you.”
</p>
<p>
“That is the reason I didn’t write.”
</p>
<p>
“What does the doctor say is the matter?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, he has not diagnosed the case satisfactorily,
but he says I have some sort of lung trouble.”
</p>
<p>
Mabel sprang to her feet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_47'></a>47</span>
</p>
<p>
“You don’t mean——” she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” interrupted her father. “I am afraid that
is what it is. He says that I must go away from
here at once.”
</p>
<p>
For a moment Mabel was too stunned to speak.
She sat down upon the edge of the bed again.
</p>
<p>
“Run away now,” said her father. “I’ll try and
sleep some more.”
</p>
<p>
She kissed her father gently, and made her way
from the room.
</p>
<p>
On the porch she met Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“Why didn’t you tell me Father was so very
sick?” she demanded.
</p>
<p>
“Pshaw!” he replied. “I don’t think it amounts
to anything.”
</p>
<p>
“You know what the doctor believes is the matter
with him?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Consumption?”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing bowed his head in assent.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_48'></a>48</span><a name='chVI' id='chVI'></a>CHAPTER VI.—A PLOT DISCOVERED.</h2>
<p>
At this moment Mabel heard Shirley calling.
Accompanied by Mr. Willing, she made her way
around the house, where her friend stood awaiting
her.
</p>
<p>
“Let’s go and look at the horses, Mabel,” said
Shirley.
</p>
<p>
In spite of a certain sadness caused by her father’s
condition, Mabel agreed, and the two girls made
their way to the large stable a quarter of a mile
from the farmhouse.
</p>
<p>
Shirley flung open the door and dashed inside.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll call on Gabriel first,” she called back over
her shoulder.
</p>
<p>
Mabel followed her.
</p>
<p>
Straight to the stall of the young animal of splendid
pedigree Shirley led the way. It had been
months since she had last seen this horse, but the
noble creature recognized her footsteps and whinnied
in delight at her approach.
</p>
<p>
Unmindful of the possibility that the horse might
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_49'></a>49</span>
step upon her, Shirley ran into the stall and, reaching
up, threw both arms around his glossy black
neck. Gabriel trembled with happiness, and then
thrust his nose into her hand.
</p>
<p>
“See,” laughed Shirley, “he wants his lump of
sugar. Did you think I had forgotten you?” she
asked.
</p>
<p>
Again Gabriel whinnied.
</p>
<p>
Gabriel took the lump of sugar from the girl’s
hand and munched it contentedly. Then he
pleaded for more.
</p>
<p>
“No, sir,” said Shirley, stepping back. “One
lump is all you get; you should know better than
to ask for more. If Dad knew I had given you
even one, he wouldn’t like it.”
</p>
<p>
She stepped farther back and surveyed the animal
with a critical eye.
</p>
<p>
“And so,” she said, speaking to Gabriel, “you
are going to win the Derby for Dad and me this
year.”
</p>
<p>
She patted him affectionately upon the head and
stroked his mane. Gabriel rubbed his head up and
down against her arm.
</p>
<p>
“Come, Shirley,” said Mabel at this juncture,
“don’t stand there talking to Gabriel all day. We
must pay our respects to some of the other horses.”
</p>
<p>
“All right,” her friend agreed and, giving Gabriel
a parting pat, she followed her friend from
the stall.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50'></a>50</span>
</p>
<p>
All along the length of the stable the heads of
other horses appeared above their stall doors as
the two girls passed along, and everywhere they
were greeted with whinnies of welcome and delight;
for there was not a horse there who did not
love the two girls.
</p>
<p>
But of all the horses in her father’s “string,”
Shirley loved Gabriel most, for he was her own
personal property. Descended from a long line of
distinguished and powerful racehorses, Gabriel had
been presented to Shirley by Mr. Willing when the
horse was nothing but a colt. His pedigree was of
the best, and now, in the approaching Derby to be
run in Louisville the following month, Shirley and
Mr. Willing both looked to him to maintain the
supremacy of the Willing stable.
</p>
<p>
Besides Jimmy Smith, Mr. Willing’s diminutive
sixteen-year-old jockey, none but Shirley had ever
sat upon Gabriel’s back. Many had tried, but the
result had always been the same. A quick leap to
the saddle, a few stiff bucks and jumps by Gabriel,
and the would-be rider was rolling on the ground.
</p>
<p>
But now when Shirley decided upon a little run,
Gabriel always received her with joy and was as
gentle as a kitten while she rode him. They often
had long gallops together, and were the best of
friends.
</p>
<p>
Gabriel was now three years old, and had been
entered for the Derby. There was no doubt in
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51'></a>51</span>
Shirley’s mind that he would be the first under
the wire at the end of the mile-and-a-quarter run
in Louisville, when the great day, August 31st, arrived.
</p>
<p>
The two girls spent perhaps an hour in the stable,
and as they were about to leave, Shirley decided to
see Gabriel once more, and so approached his stall.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly she halted in her tracks and laid a
warning finger to her lips. Mabel also stopped.
</p>
<p>
“What is it?” she whispered.
</p>
<p>
“I thought I heard strange voices in there,” said
Shirley, pointing to Gabriel’s stall.
</p>
<p>
“Impossible,” returned Mabel in a low voice.
“Gabriel wouldn’t allow a stranger in there. He
would kick him to pieces.”
</p>
<p>
Silently she approached closer, and stood still,
listening intently.
</p>
<p>
Then only the two girls heard a voice they recognized.
</p>
<p>
“Jimmy,” said Mabel. “You were mistaken, Shirley.”
</p>
<p>
She started to go closer, but Shirley stopped her
with a whispered word of caution.
</p>
<p>
“There is some one else there, too! Listen.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” came the voice of Jimmy Smith, “he is
in fine shape, as you see. He will be in perfect condition
for the Derby. He is sure to win.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, he’ll win, all right,” was the answer, in a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52'></a>52</span>
voice that neither Shirley nor Mabel recognized.
“He’ll win unless something happens.”
</p>
<p>
“But what can happen to him?” inquired Jimmy.
“He is being nursed carefully. I am attending to
him myself. No other hand but mine touches him,
unless it is that of Miss Shirley; and I have promised
to have him perfectly fit for the big race.”
</p>
<p>
“That,” said the stranger in a hoarse whisper, “is
what I have come to see you about.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?” asked Jimmy.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said the stranger, “I represent a syndicate
of bookmakers. You know what bookmakers
are, don’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes: a bookmaker is a man who lives by betting
on the races.”
</p>
<p>
“Almost that. He is a man who lives by allowing
others to bet with him. Now, after looking over
all the horses entered for the Derby, we have come
to the conclusion that Gabriel is bound to win if
the race is absolutely straight.”
</p>
<p>
“Straight,” repeated Jimmy. “What do you
mean?”
</p>
<p>
“Just what I say. If Gabriel is allowed to win, we
stand to lose considerable money. But if he should
lose——” the stranger paused.
</p>
<p>
“But he won’t lose,” said Jimmy confidently.
</p>
<p>
“He will if you will help us,” said the stranger.
</p>
<p>
“Why should I help you?” asked Jimmy.
</p>
<p>
“Because,” said the stranger, “there will be money
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53'></a>53</span>
in it for you. What would you say to five hundred
dollars?”
</p>
<p>
Both girls heard Jimmy give a slight gasp.
</p>
<p>
“Five hundred dollars,” he repeated slowly.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” was the reply, “then your sister, who is
so ill, may receive the proper medical attention.”
</p>
<p>
“How do you know of my sick sister?” asked
Jimmy in surprise.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, we know many things,” was the reply. “For
instance, we know that your employer is paying you
very little, because he hasn’t anything to pay you
with. He has lost practically everything playing the
races.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Jimmy, “that is true. He told me
that everything depended upon Gabriel’s winning
the Derby.”
</p>
<p>
“But if Gabriel did win,” protested the stranger,
“what would you get? Not much; and here I am
offering you five hundred dollars!”
</p>
<p>
“But you are asking me to be a traitor to my
trust,” said Jimmy.
</p>
<p>
“Not at all. I am simply showing you how to
make the money you so badly need. Come, what
do you say?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” said Jimmy slowly. “I don’t
know.”
</p>
<p>
“Here,” said the strange voice after a pause, “is
my card. I shall give you a week to consider.
Write me at this address, and I will tell you where
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54'></a>54</span>
you can meet me, and we will have another talk.
You will surely do that, won’t you?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Jimmy. “I will do that.”
</p>
<p>
“Good. Now I am going up to see your boss.”
</p>
<p>
There was a sound of persons moving and, taking
Mabel by the arm, Shirley quickly drew her
into the nearest stall, where they stooped down to
be out of sight.
</p>
<p>
Footsteps passed along the outside, and a moment
later the girls heard the voices of Jimmy and
the stranger outside the stable.
</p>
<p>
“Quick,” whispered Shirley, “we must get out
of here without being seen.”
</p>
<p>
Making sure that there was no one near, they
emerged from the stall and, running the length of
the stable, came out at the other end.
</p>
<p>
Hurrying to the shelter of a magnificent oak tree
a hundred yards away, they sat down. For some
minutes Shirley was silent, and Mabel did not interrupt
her meditations. But at last Shirley spoke.
</p>
<p>
“And to think that Jimmy Smith would even consider
a thing like that,” she said slowly.
</p>
<p>
“It does seem impossible, doesn’t it?” replied
Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“After all Dad has done for him,” continued Shirley.
“Why, I remember the day Dad found him
lying beside the pike. He was ragged and dirty,
and had fallen from exhaustion. He had not eaten
for two days, he said. And it was true. Dad
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55'></a>55</span>
brought him home with us, and when he became
stronger, offered him work, although Dad did not
need him. That was two years ago, and he has
been with us ever since. We have had entire confidence
in him.
</p>
<p>
“I remember how pleased Dad was when he found
Jimmy loved horses, and that horses loved him.
He has carried our colors to victory more than
once. And now to think that he would even consider
selling Dad out. What shall we do?”
</p>
<p>
“I would tell your father immediately,” said
Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“It would seem best, wouldn’t it?” said Shirley.
“But he is so fond of Jimmy that I hate to do it.”
</p>
<p>
She was silent for some moments.
</p>
<p>
“My gracious!” she exclaimed at length. “I
have it.”
</p>
<p>
“Have what?”
</p>
<p>
“A plan.”
</p>
<p>
“What is it?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I haven’t had time to work it out yet, but
when I do, I shall tell you. Now I want you to
promise you will say nothing of what we have
overheard to any one.”
</p>
<p>
“I promise, of course,” said Mabel, “but I wonder
if I should.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56'></a>56</span><a name='chVII' id='chVII'></a>CHAPTER VII.—MR. WILLING PROMISES.</h2>
<p>
The girls were still sitting there half an hour
later, when Jimmy Smith ran into them.
</p>
<p>
“Miss Shirley!” he cried eagerly, and approached
with outstretched hand. “Mr. Willing told me you
were back, and I have been hunting all over the
place for you.”
</p>
<p>
He turned to Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“And how are you, Miss Mabel?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
Both girls returned his greeting cordially, not
showing in any way that they knew of his talk
with the stranger.
</p>
<p>
“We are so glad to be back, Jimmy,” said Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Have you seen Gabriel yet?” asked Jimmy. “He
has been wanting to see you.”
</p>
<p>
“How do you know that?” asked Mabel with a
slight smile.
</p>
<p>
“Why, he told me so.”
</p>
<p>
“Told you?” laughed Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“To be sure,” said Jimmy quietly. “Gabriel and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57'></a>57</span>
I have a language of our own, and when I told him
Miss Shirley was coming back he just told me how
anxious he had been to see you ever since you went
away.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’m glad he missed me,” said Shirley.
“Come, Mabel, I want to have a long talk with
Dad.”
</p>
<p>
They left Jimmy and sought Mr. Willing. They
found him a few minutes later, seated on the big
front porch, deep in conversation with a stranger.
Both girls felt sure that he was the man who tried
to bribe Jimmy only a short time before.
</p>
<p>
They would have gone into the house but Mr.
Willing called them.
</p>
<p>
“I want you to know my daughter, Mr. Jones,”
he said to his visitor; “and also Miss Mabel Ashton,
the daughter of my old friend, Colonel Ashton,
whom you know.”
</p>
<p>
The man called Mr. Jones arose, and extended his
hand, but the girls, pretending not to see it, acknowledged
the introductions with the briefest of
nods.
</p>
<p>
Jones noticed the unmistakable hostility in their
manner, and withdrew his hand quickly. Mr. Willing
also noticed it, and scowled slightly. The girls
said nothing, and a moment later Mr. Willing said:
“You girls run along now.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley and Mabel accepted their dismissal with
gladness, and went into the house. Mr. Willing,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58'></a>58</span>
having disposed of his visitor half an hour later,
followed them. He turned to Shirley sharply.
</p>
<p>
“In the future,” he said, “you will treat your
father’s friends with more respect than you did Mr.
Jones.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t like him,” said Shirley.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing stepped back in surprise.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t like him?” he said in some amazement.
“And because you don’t like one of my
friends, is that any reason you should not treat him
with respect?”
</p>
<p>
“I wasn’t disrespectful,” said Shirley, with something
like a pout.
</p>
<p>
“You weren’t, eh? I’d like to know what you call
it.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I don’t like him,” said Shirley again,
</p>
<p>
“Why don’t you like him?” demanded Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
Shirley, mindful of the task she had set for herself,
found it difficult to answer this question without
arousing suspicion in her father’s mind, and for
Jimmy’s sake she did not wish to do this. So she
answered: “I just don’t.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing threw up his hands in a gesture of
dismay.
</p>
<p>
“Girls and women are too much for me,” he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
He would have walked away, but Shirley stayed
him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59'></a>59</span>
</p>
<p>
“I want to have a private talk with you, Dad,”
she said.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing looked at his daughter in surprise.
</p>
<p>
“Well, well,” he said finally, “you are getting to
be quite a young lady, aren’t you? Want to have a
private talk with me, eh? All right. Come into
my sitting room.”
</p>
<p>
He led the way, and Shirley followed, after motioning
to Mabel to await her return.
</p>
<p>
Seated in his big arm chair, with Shirley on the
floor at his feet, Mr. Willing drew a cigar from his
pocket, lighted it, fell back in the chair and puffed
luxuriously.
</p>
<p>
“Now fire away,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Dad,” said Shirley, coming to the point at
once, “is it true that you have lost all your money?”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing came out of his chair with a bound.
</p>
<p>
“Who has been putting such notions into my little
girl’s head?” he asked, but his voice was slightly
strained.
</p>
<p>
Shirley was not deceived.
</p>
<p>
“Is it true that you have lost large sums on horse
races?” she demanded.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing looked at his only daughter long and
earnestly.
</p>
<p>
“Would it please you very much if I gave up
gambling?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, indeed it would, Dad,” said Shirley, rising
to her feet.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60'></a>60</span>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing considered.
</p>
<p>
“Then here is what I will do,” he said at length.
“I promise that after this one time, I will never bet
a cent again.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley shook her head.
</p>
<p>
“No,” she said.
</p>
<p>
“You mean,” demanded her father, “that you
even want me to let this sure thing go by?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“But after the comforts you have been used to,
think how hard that will make it.”
</p>
<p>
“I can do with less,” said Shirley quietly.
</p>
<p>
“Do you realize,” said Mr. Willing, “that if I do
as you say, and Gabriel wins, and he must, all we
shall have is the prize, when we might have four
times that much?”
</p>
<p>
“Is the farm clear?” demanded Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, but I was figuring on raising some money
on it to recoup my earlier losses.”
</p>
<p>
“Then,” said Shirley, “if the farm is clear, and
Gabriel wins, we shall have enough. What more do
we need?”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing hesitated, and Shirley continued.
</p>
<p>
“Come, Dad, promise me before it is too late.
Mother would wish it, were she alive. You know
that. We’ll get along some way. Come, Dad, will
you promise?”
</p>
<p>
She stood tip and threw her arms around her
father’s neck. Mr. Willing held her in a close
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61'></a>61</span>
embrace for several moments, and as he looked over
her head he saw, in memory, another face that also
seemed to plead with him.
</p>
<p>
He stepped back and held Shirley off at arms’
length, and for a long time gazed at her in silence.
</p>
<p>
“You are so like your mother,” he said quietly,
“I can refuse you nothing.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you will promise?” asked Shirley eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Mr. Willing slowly, “I promise.”
</p>
<p>
“There never was a better Daddy,” exclaimed
Shirley.
</p>
<p>
Laughing happily, she threw both arms around
him and squeezed him tightly.
</p>
<p>
“Stop, stop,” laughed Mr. Willing, “or you will
make me sorry I promised.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley released him, and he patted her on the
back affectionately.
</p>
<p>
“Run away now,” he said, “and leave your old
Daddy here to think.”
</p>
<p>
With a parting kiss, Shirley left him, and rejoined
Mabel on the porch.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_62'></a>62</span><a name='chVIII' id='chVIII'></a>CHAPTER VIII.—A ROAD ADVENTURE.</h2>
<p>
The morning following the girls’ arrival, Mr.
Willing and Mr. Ashton, who was feeling much
better, were seated with the girls around the breakfast
table.
</p>
<p>
“Mabel and I are going to town this morning,”
said Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“All right,” said Mr. Willing. “I’ll tell Frank
to hitch up. What time will you be ready?”
</p>
<p>
“Ten o’clock will be early enough, I reckon,” said
Shirley. “We probably won’t be home until late
this afternoon.”
</p>
<p>
It was the first time the girls had been in the
little town of Paris, except for a few minutes on
their way back from Illinois, since school had closed
for the summer vacation. Therefore, they called
on some of their girl friends, and spent a very
pleasant day.
</p>
<p>
They did some shopping and it was after five
o’clock when they started for home.
</p>
<p>
“It looks as though there was going to be a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_63'></a>63</span>
storm,” said the livery-stable keeper, where they
had left their horse.
</p>
<p>
Mabel glanced at the sky. Huge clouds were
gathering in the west.
</p>
<p>
“They look like wind clouds,” said Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“You had better wait,” said the stableman. “You
will be caught in the storm.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, I think we’ll make it,” said Shirley. “Besides,
Dad expects us in time for supper.”
</p>
<p>
“Telephone him,” said the man.
</p>
<p>
“No,” said Shirley, “we’ll run the risk.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, all right,” was the reply, “but you had
better hurry.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley shook out the reins, and touched the horse
lightly with her whip. The animal started off at
a rapid trot.
</p>
<p>
It was a good three miles home, and Mabel, glancing
once more at the sky, urged Shirley to hurry.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll get a good soaking,” she said.
</p>
<p>
“It won’t hurt us any,” said Shirley. “I’m sure
I won’t melt, and I don’t think you will.”
</p>
<p>
They continued up Main Street, and finally
reached the outskirts of the town.
</p>
<p>
“Guess we can go a little faster now,” said Shirley,
and touched the horse with her whip.
</p>
<p>
At that moment there came a brilliant flash of
lightning, followed by a terrific peal of thunder.
The horse shied and broke into a gallop.
</p>
<p>
Shirley tightened her hold on the reins, and, with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_64'></a>64</span>
an effort, succeeded in pulling him down to a trot
again.
</p>
<p>
“Well, here’s where we turn off, anyhow,” said
Shirley. “If the rain will hold off for twenty minutes
we will be all right.”
</p>
<p>
“And then, just as they turned onto the Bethlehem
pike, darkness enveloped them, shutting out the
sight of the road ahead. It descended so suddenly
and unexpectedly that Mabel cried out in alarm.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be frightened,” said Shirley in a low
voice. “I know the road and can drive just as well
in the dark.”
</p>
<p>
Nevertheless she was forced to check the horse
slightly, and this required great effort, for the animal,
badly frightened, was trying to bolt.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly Shirley’s hat went flying from her head,
as the wind was blowing a gale. Mabel, her hands
free, caught hers as it left her head.
</p>
<p>
“Mine’s gone,” cried Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Shall we stop and get it?” asked Mabel, raising
her voice to make herself heard above the roaring
wind.
</p>
<p>
“I should say not,” was the reply. “We’ll get
home just as quick as we can.”
</p>
<p>
Their horse, at this moment, was puffing up a
steep hill. The wind was blowing fiercely. The
girls felt a few drops of rain upon their faces.
</p>
<p>
And then, above the roaring of the wind, came
another sound—the sound of a horse coming rapidly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_65'></a>65</span>
toward them. Mabel heard it first, and called to
Shirley. Shirley pulled as far to the right as she
felt was safe, being absolutely unable to see in the
darkness.
</p>
<p>
A sudden flash of lightning lit the scene before
them, and Mabel uttered an involuntary cry of fear.
</p>
<p>
Not fifty yards away, and bearing down on them,
came a galloping horse. The one flash had permitted
the girls to see that he was running wild.
There was no one in the buggy.
</p>
<p>
Shirley pulled desperately upon the right rein,
turning her horse sharply from the road. Her action
undoubtedly saved them from serious injury,
but it was not quick enough to entirely avert disaster.
</p>
<p>
There was a sudden crash, and both girls felt
the left side of the buggy sink and then crash to
the ground. The wheel of the other and heavier
vehicle had smashed the two left-hand wheels and
carried them away. The other buggy had been damaged
in the same manner, but the frightened horse
did not pause in his wild race, and dashed on
down the road, dragging the broken buggy after
him. In spite of the accident, Shirley maintained
a firm grip on the reins, and when the left side of
the buggy went down to the ground she managed
to bring her horse to a stop almost at once.
</p>
<p>
But Mabel was not so fortunate. When the
buggy had collapsed she was thrown out, and badly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_66'></a>66</span>
shaken when she came in contact with the hard
ground.
</p>
<p>
She pulled herself to her feet dizzily and stood
still. Some distance down the road she could hear
the bumping of Shirley’s buggy, and she heard it
finally come to a stop. She could not see a foot
in front of her, but started slowly in the direction
she knew Shirley must be.
</p>
<p>
As soon as the horse stopped, Shirley called to
Mabel not to be frightened. Receiving no response,
she felt along the seat beside her. Mabel was not
there.
</p>
<p>
Jumping quickly from the damaged buggy, unmindful
of the horse, Shirley turned and hurried in
the direction from which she had come. Twice she
called and received no response. The third time
she thought she heard Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Here I am,” screamed Mabel, trying to make
herself heard above the howling wind.
</p>
<p>
A moment later they found each other.
</p>
<p>
“Are you much hurt?” Shirley asked her friend
anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“No,” said Mabel. “I am pretty well shaken
up, but I am all right. And you?”
</p>
<p>
“Perfectly safe,” replied Shirley. “The question
now is what to do.”
</p>
<p>
Still the rain held off, only a few drops falling
occasionally but the wind blew violently.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_67'></a>67</span>
</p>
<p>
“We had better climb up on Cato and ride home
that way,” said Mabel. (Cato was their horse.)
</p>
<p>
“A good idea,” spoke Shirley. “Come!”
</p>
<p>
She led the way to where she thought Cato would
be standing, but she could not find him.
</p>
<p>
“Strange,” she told herself. “I am sure it was
here that I stopped him.”
</p>
<p>
Just then there came another flash of lightning,
and far down the road, they saw Cato and the broken
buggy making rapidly for home.
</p>
<p>
In spite of the serious situation, Shirley laughed.
</p>
<p>
“What do you think of that?” she exclaimed.
“Cato has run away and left us. I’ll speak to him
about it when we get home.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, we must not stand here,” said Mabel impatiently.
“We can walk home in half an hour.
Let’s start.”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose that is the best way,” said Shirley.
</p>
<p>
They started down the road, walking rapidly.
</p>
<p>
And now it began to rain. Lightning flashed
and terrific peals of thunder reverberated through
the air. By no means of timid dispositions, both
girls, nevertheless, became nervous.
</p>
<p>
“Hadn’t we better stop under one of these trees?”
asked Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“No,” Shirley decided instantly. “I have heard
it is dangerous in an electric storm. Lightning may
strike the tree. We are safer in the middle of the
pike, even if we do get soaking wet.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_68'></a>68</span>
</p>
<p>
The rain fell in torrents, and both girls by this
time were drenched to the skin.
</p>
<p>
They hurried down a steep declivity in the road.
There was one more hill to climb, and then the long
walk from the pike to the house.
</p>
<p>
They reached the top of the hill ten minutes later
and turned in at the first gate.
</p>
<p>
“I thought Cato would be here,” said Shirley.
</p>
<p>
But there was no sign of horse or buggy.
</p>
<p>
The two girls hurried down the road, now muddy
from the downpour. It was hard walking, and they
made slow progress.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll bet the creek has overflowed,” said Shirley.
“If so, we will wade part of the way.”
</p>
<p>
“I am very much afraid you are right,” said
Mabel.
</p>
<p>
Now they came to the second gate, and passed
through it. They descended the little hill toward
the creek slowly, for there was no telling how high
the water might be.
</p>
<p>
It was good they had been so cautious. They
had hardly walked ten paces when Shirley drew
back suddenly. She had come upon water.
</p>
<p>
“My gracious,” she exclaimed. “I had no idea
the water could rise so high in such a short time.”
</p>
<p>
“I doubt if we can get across,” said Mabel.
</p>
<p>
Shirley took Mabel by the hand.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll try,” she said briefly.
</p>
<p>
Very slowly they continued their way.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_69'></a>69</span>
</p>
<p>
The water rose to their shoe tops, then to their
knees, and still they went on.
</p>
<p>
“It can’t be much deeper,” said Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” said Shirley. “I have never seen
it this high, but I have heard Dad say that forty
years ago it rose until it was impossible to cross
for two days.”
</p>
<p>
The water had now reached their waists, and was
still rising. Fortunately there was no current to
speak of, so there was little danger so long as they
kept their heads above water.
</p>
<p>
But when the water reached their armpits and
continued to rise, Shirley turned back.
</p>
<p>
“It’s no use,” she said.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_70'></a>70</span><a name='chIX' id='chIX'></a>CHAPTER IX.—SHIRLEY GETS BUSY.</h2>
<p>
“No,” Mabel agreed, “it’s no use. But what are
we going to do now?”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll have to wait, that’s all,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
Shivering and cold, Mabel turned her face to the
sky and the rain fell upon it.
</p>
<p>
“Wait here in this rain?” she demanded.
</p>
<p>
“What else is there to do?” asked Shirley. “I
am just as anxious to get in as you are, and if you
will suggest a plan we will act upon it.”
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t any plan,” replied Mabel mournfully.
</p>
<p>
In spite of her discomfort, Shirley was forced to
smile to herself. Her friend’s tone amused her.
</p>
<p>
“I’m going to sit down,” said Shirley, and suited
the action to the word.
</p>
<p>
Mabel also sat down in the mud.
</p>
<p>
“We can’t get any wetter nor any dirtier,” said
Shirley, “so we may as well make ourselves as comfortable
as possible.”
</p>
<p>
“How long do you suppose we shall have to stay
here?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_71'></a>71</span>
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t any idea. Perhaps all night.”
</p>
<p>
“All night?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Of course, it is possible that Dad will have
telephoned to town inquiring about us. If he called
up the stable and learns that we have started, he
may come looking for us. That’s the only thing that
will save us an all-night stay in the rain.”
</p>
<p>
“But how would he get across the creek?”
</p>
<p>
“If Dad starts looking for me,” said Shirley, “it
will take more than this to stop him.”
</p>
<p>
The two girls became silent, and huddled as close
together as they could, for in their wet garments
they were chilled to the bone, and the air was very
cool, in spite of the season.
</p>
<p>
How long they sat there they did not know, but
they jumped at the sound of a horse’s hoofs on the
opposite side of the stream.
</p>
<p>
“Who’s there?” cried Shirley, rising to her feet
and pulling her chum up after her.
</p>
<p>
“Is that you, Shirley?” came a shout.
</p>
<p>
“Dad!” cried Shirley. “Yes, Mabel and I are
here.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll be across in a jiffy,” called the father.
</p>
<p>
“Be careful, Dad,” called Shirley, “the water is
very deep. We tried to get across and couldn’t.”
</p>
<p>
There was no reply from the opposite side, but
a moment later the splashing of water gave evidence
that a horse was floundering into it. A few
minutes later, dripping wet, Mr. Willing pulled up
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_72'></a>72</span>
in front of the two girls, who had advanced to the
edge of the water to meet him.
</p>
<p>
He dismounted quickly, and caught Shirley in his
arms.
</p>
<p>
“Where is Cato?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
In a few words Shirley explained.
</p>
<p>
“You are both soaked,” exclaimed Mr. Willing.
“You must get home to bed at once.”
</p>
<p>
He turned to Shirley and would have lifted her
to the saddle, but she protested.
</p>
<p>
“Take Mabel first,” she said.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing knew his daughter, and therefore he
did not question her decision. Without a word he
turned to Mabel and lifted her gently to the saddle.
Then he swung himself up in front of her.
</p>
<p>
The horse plunged again into the creek, and in
a few moments Mabel was safe on the other side.
</p>
<p>
“Now you run to the house as quick as you can
get there,” said Mr. Willing as he handed her
down.
</p>
<p>
Mabel wasted no time, and set out for the house
on a run, while Mr. Willing turned his horse’s face
toward the stream, and went after his daughter.
</p>
<p>
The second trip was made without incident, and
Shirley found herself being borne toward the house
in her father’s arms. Wet and bedraggled, she
snuggled close to him, and though the trip to the
house took but a few minutes, she was half asleep
when he called to her to jump down.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_73'></a>73</span>
</p>
<p>
“Go to bed at once,” he commanded. “If you
are not careful you will be sick. You are not strong
enough for such experiences.”
</p>
<p>
But Shirley must stop and kiss him first, and then
she left him with a word of caution.
</p>
<p>
“I am just as strong as you are, Dad. You, too,
are soaking. Mind, you change your clothes at
once.”
</p>
<p>
“Good night,” said her father, and Shirley ran
into the house. There, at the foot of the steps stood
Mabel, waiting for her.
</p>
<p>
The two girls ran quickly to their room. Later,
when Mr. Willing looked in to see them, they were
sleeping soundly.
</p>
<p>
“Poor children,” he said softly. “They have had
a hard night. I shall let them sleep late to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>
But Shirley and Mabel, in spite of the hardships
of the night before, were up bright and early, and
down in the kitchen talking to “Aunt” Charlotte,
the old colored cook, while she prepared breakfast.
</p>
<p>
Shortly after breakfast, Shirley, with an air of
great importance, drew Mabel back to their room.
</p>
<p>
“Now,” she said, “I shall explain the plan I have
formed to save Jimmy Smith.”
</p>
<p>
“What is it?” asked Mabel eagerly.
</p>
<p>
Shirley seated herself comfortably before she
spoke and told Mabel to do the same. Her reply
was a question.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_74'></a>74</span>
</p>
<p>
“Have you ever noticed,” she asked, “how closely
Jimmy Smith and I resemble each other?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” said Mabel. “Father and I have
often spoken of it. Others also have noticed the
resemblance. Why?”
</p>
<p>
“Because,” said Shirley, slowly and distinctly, “in
that resemblance lies the success of my plan.”
</p>
<p>
Mabel looked at her friend in astonishment.
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?” she demanded.
</p>
<p>
Shirley smiled a little at her chum’s very evident
surprise.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll tell you,” she replied, and settled herself
to explain. “You remember, of course, that Mr.
Jones,”—she spoke the “Mr.” with a touch of sarcasm—“told
Jimmy Smith to communicate with
him if he considered his proposition favorably?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, the first thing I want to do is to get the
address he gave Jimmy. Then I—not Jimmy—shall
communicate with him. I’ll tell him I have
decided to accept his offer, and that I should like
to have another talk with him; and I’ll sign the
letter ‘Jimmy Smith.’”
</p>
<p>
“But what good will that do?”
</p>
<p>
“It will do a whole lot of good.”
</p>
<p>
“But I can’t see——”
</p>
<p>
“It will do a whole lot of good,” explained Shirley
quietly, “because when Mr. Jones has an interview with
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_75'></a>75</span>
Jimmy Smith, he will have an interview
with me, disguised as Jimmy Smith.”
</p>
<p>
Mabel jumped to her feet in surprise.
</p>
<p>
“You mean that you—” she began.
</p>
<p>
“Exactly,” interrupted Shirley. “Jimmy Smith
will know nothing about the matter.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley sat back in her chair and beamed at her
friend.
</p>
<p>
“Now what do you think of my plan?” she
asked.
</p>
<p>
“I think it’s foolish,” was Mabel’s prompt response.
“You are sure to get yourself in trouble.
Suppose your identity should be discovered?”
</p>
<p>
“But it won’t. Jimmy and I look too much alike
for that. Besides, the very boldness of the plan
will work in my favor. In any event, I am going
to try it, and I need your help.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course I shall help,” said Mabel, “but just
the same I think you would do a whole lot better
to tell your father the whole business.”
</p>
<p>
“And have Jimmy Smith thrown off the place?
I should say not.”
</p>
<p>
“But if he considers doing a thing like that, he
should be thrown off the place.”
</p>
<p>
“No,” said Shirley gravely. “It is his first temptation,
and we should do what we can to save him.”
</p>
<p>
“But,” said Mabel, “if you write to Mr. Jones,
and he answers, he will naturally address his reply
to ‘Jimmy Smith,’ and Jimmy will get it.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_76'></a>76</span>
</p>
<p>
“Goodness gracious,” ejaculated Shirley. “I
hadn’t thought of that.”
</p>
<p>
She was silent some moments and then continued:
</p>
<p>
“Well, then, when I find the address, I’ll simply
write and tell him to meet me in a certain place.”
</p>
<p>
“That will be much better,” agreed Mabel. “But,
honestly, Shirley, I don’t think much of the plan.
You are sure to get into trouble of some kind.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps,” said Shirley with a shrug of her shoulders,
“but I’ll get out all right. Besides, I shall
be saving Jimmy; and, after all, the saving of one
boy’s honor is surely worth the risk.”
</p>
<p>
Mabel was struck with a new thought.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps Jimmy has already written.”
</p>
<p>
“I hardly think so,” was the reply. “It is too
soon.”
</p>
<p>
“But he may write after you do, and thus lead to
your discovery.”
</p>
<p>
“I had thought of that,” said Shirley, “and for
that reason we must manage to get the address
away from him at once. He is hardly likely to
remember it, and when he cannot find the card he
probably will forget all about the matter.”
</p>
<p>
“But——” began Mabel.
</p>
<p>
Shirley waved her right hand impatiently.
</p>
<p>
“My gracious,” she exclaimed, “don’t be looking
for trouble all the time. I know there is a risk,
but we shall have to take it. Now the first thing
to do is to get the card from Jimmy.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_77'></a>77</span>
</p>
<p>
“And how do you expect to manage that?”
</p>
<p>
“Just leave that to me,” said Shirley, airily. “I’ll
get it, and he won’t know anything about it.”
</p>
<p>
“All right,” said Mabel, doubtfully, “but——”
</p>
<p>
Shirley cut short these protests.
</p>
<p>
“Come with me,” she said, and led the way from
the room.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_78'></a>78</span><a name='chX' id='chX'></a>CHAPTER X.—SETTING THE TRAP.</h2>
<p>
They found Jimmy Smith in the stable leaning
over Gabriel’s stall and talking to him in low tones.
The lad stepped back and lifted his cap from his
head as the two girls approached.
</p>
<p>
“Are you telling Gabriel that he must win the
Derby, Jimmy?” asked Shirley with a bright smile.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Miss,” was the reply. “Gabriel and I have
many talks, and he always promises me that he
will win.”
</p>
<p>
“But, suppose he should lose?”
</p>
<p>
“He can’t lose,” said Jimmy decisively.
</p>
<p>
“Are you sure?” asked Shirley sharply.
</p>
<p>
Jimmy looked at her queerly.
</p>
<p>
“Why—I—yes—of course he can’t,” he stammered.
</p>
<p>
“But suppose something should happen?” persisted
Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?” asked Jimmy, plainly startled.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, nothing,” said Shirley, and changed the
subject abruptly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_79'></a>79</span>
</p>
<p>
“Jimmy,” she said a few moments later, “I wish
you would go up in the loft and see how much
hay there is up there.”
</p>
<p>
“All right, Miss,” said the boy, and reached for
his coat, which hung over the stall door.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t need the coat,” said Shirley. “Hurry
up, please. Dad is anxious to know right away.”
</p>
<p>
Without another word, but with a sidelong glance
at the coat, Jimmy hastened to obey. He clambered
up the ladder quickly.
</p>
<p>
Hardly had his hand disappeared when Shirley
stepped quickly forward and took up the coat. Rapidly
she explored the pockets, one after another,
and, at last, drawing forth a small piece of paste-board,
she gave a little cry of triumph.
</p>
<p>
“I have it,” she whispered to Mabel.
</p>
<p>
She slipped the card into her dress, and hastily
put the coat back where she had found it. She
was leaning over the stall door talking to Gabriel
when Jimmy came down the ladder.
</p>
<p>
“Plenty of hay for two weeks, Miss Shirley,”
said Jimmy.
</p>
<p>
He reached out cautiously and picked up his coat,
which he donned with an audible sigh of relief.
</p>
<p>
“All right, then,” said Shirley. “Come, Mabel,
we may as well go.”
</p>
<p>
She gave Gabriel another little pat, and led the
way from the stable.
</p>
<p>
“I feel like I had picked somebody’s pocket,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_80'></a>80</span>
Shirley confided to Mabel, as they made their way
back toward the house.
</p>
<p>
“You have,” replied her friend, “and I don’t know
whether you were right or not.”
</p>
<p>
“The end will justify the means,” said Shirley
quietly. “It’s for Jimmy’s own good, for my
father’s good, and for the good of others. I am
sure I did no wrong.”
</p>
<p>
They sat down on the porch and talked for some
moments.
</p>
<p>
“Look,” said Mabel suddenly, “here comes Jimmy.
I wonder what is the matter with him. He
seems to be looking for something.”
</p>
<p>
In truth, he did seem to be looking for something.
The boy seemed greatly excited, and his
eyes roved about the ground as he approached.
</p>
<p>
“It’s the card he misses,” said Shirley. “He
thinks he has lost it.”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t suppose he suspects us, do you?”
</p>
<p>
“I hope not.”
</p>
<p>
Jimmy was close to them now, and Shirley called
out: “What’s the matter, Jimmy? Lost something?”
</p>
<p>
Jimmy, unaware of their presence until then,
looked up in confusion.
</p>
<p>
“No—no, Miss Shirley,” he stammered, and disappeared.
</p>
<p>
“Poor Jimmy,” said Shirley. “One evil leads to
another. He was forced to lie, you see. Come,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_81'></a>81</span>
Mabel, let’s go upstairs and have a look at this
card, and figure out a letter to Mr. Jones that will
do the work.”
</p>
<p>
Mabel followed her friend up the stairs, where
both sat down, and Shirley produced the card.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. A. B. Jones,” she read, “Fifth Avenue Hotel,
Louisville, Ky.”
</p>
<p>
“Very well, Mr. Jones,” she said, “we shall attend
to your case.”
</p>
<p>
She turned to Mabel. “What do you think?”
she asked. “Would it be better to ask him to meet
me in Paris, Lexington, or where?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” replied Mabel. “But it seems
to me that Paris is pretty close to your home. Besides,
Jimmy is well known in Lexington also.”
</p>
<p>
“True,” said Shirley. “I think I shall select Cincinnati.”
</p>
<p>
“Goodness,” said Mabel, “that is a long ways.”
</p>
<p>
“So it is,” said Shirley, “but I can make an excuse
to go there. I can tell father we are going
to spend a couple of days with Clara Morton. He
will not object.”
</p>
<p>
“Suit yourself,” said Mabel. “I reckon it might
as well be there as any place else. It probably will
be safer too. We can stay with Clara while there.”
</p>
<p>
“My idea exactly,” said Shirley. “Now let’s see
if I can write the proper kind of a letter.”
</p>
<p>
She drew forth some paper—and wrote long and
earnestly. Sheet after sheet she tore up, but at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_82'></a>82</span>
last, with a little cry of satisfaction, she took the
last sheet, upon which she had just written, and
passed it to Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“I think that will do very well.”
</p>
<p>
Mabel read:
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
“Mr. <span class='sc'>A. B. Jones</span>:—Dear Sir:—I have considered
your offer. I shall be in Cincinnati, Palace
Hotel, Friday. If offer is still open, meet me in
the lobby at 6 o’clock Friday night. I am going
to Cincinnati on an errand for Miss Willing.
</p>
<p style='text-align:right; margin-top:0; margin-bottom:0; margin-right:2em;;'>“<span class='sc'>Jimmy Smith.</span>”</p>
<p>
Mabel read the letter over several times.
</p>
<p>
“I guess it is all right,” she said at last. “There
is only one thing I would suggest.”
</p>
<p>
“What is it?”
</p>
<p>
“I would add a line and say, ‘Under no circumstances
write me!’”
</p>
<p>
“Good,” said Shirley. “I’ll do it.”
</p>
<p>
She did, and then addressing an envelope, the
two girls walked up to the mail box at the pike
and waited the passing of the rural mail carrier.
They did not wish the letter to remain in the box
unguarded, because some one might see it.
</p>
<p>
But with the letter in the mailman’s hands, Shirley
felt more comfortable. The two girls walked
back to the house.
</p>
<p>
“With good luck,” said Shirley, “that is, if Dad
doesn’t object, we should be able to leave here
Thursday morning. We will send Clara a telegram
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_83'></a>83</span>
from town telling her to meet us. Now we’ll go
and see what Dad has to say.”
</p>
<p>
“So you want to go away again, eh?” said Mr.
Willing, after Shirley had suggested the trip. “And
how long do you want to be gone?”
</p>
<p>
“Until Sunday or Monday, Dad,” said Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Mr. Willing, after a long pause, “I
can see no reason why you cannot go if Mr. Ashton
doesn’t object.”
</p>
<p>
“I am sure he won’t,” said Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Better go and ask him then,” said Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
Mabel hurried to obey, and returned in a few
moments with her father’s consent.
</p>
<p>
“You want to go Thursday?” asked Mr. Willing.
“Why, that’s day after to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>
“I know that,” said Shirley with a smile.
</p>
<p>
“All right,” said Mr. Willing. “I am going to
town this afternoon. I’ll send Clara a telegram
myself to meet you.”
</p>
<p>
The matter settled, Shirley and Mabel began
their preparations for the trip.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t anticipate much trouble,” said Shirley.
“Of course you never can tell just what will happen,
and for that reason I am going to take my
little pocket revolver.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I shall take mine, too,” said Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“That is hardly necessary,” said Shirley, “for,
of course, I shall see Mr. Jones alone.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_84'></a>84</span>
</p>
<p>
“Aren’t you going to let me go with you?” demanded
Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“No,” said Shirley, “that might spoil everything.
Mr. Jones might suspect something even if he didn’t
recognize either of us.”
</p>
<p>
“But I can’t let you face the danger alone,” protested
Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Who said anything about danger?” demanded
Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Why, didn’t you?” asked Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“No.”
</p>
<p>
“Then why do you take your revolver?”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Shirley with a smile, “it is always
best to be prepared for the unexpected.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I suppose you will have it your own
way,” said Mabel.
</p>
<p>
Shirley smiled.
</p>
<p>
“In this, yes,” she replied.
</p>
<p>
The two days passed slowly for both girls, but
at length the time came to go. The first thing in
the morning, making sure that Jimmy was in the
stable, Shirley made her way to his room and appropriated
one of his old suits—one that she was
sure he would not miss. This she packed in her
suitcase.
</p>
<p>
“I shall have to buy a wig in Cincinnati,” she
told Mabel.
</p>
<p>
Clara met the girls at the train, and they were
soon whirled to her Walnut Hills home in a large
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_85'></a>85</span>
automobile. There they were to remain until the
following afternoon, when Mabel would accompany
Shirley downtown.
</p>
<p>
The next day, shortly before five o’clock, Shirley
slipped her dress on over her suit of boy’s
clothes, and leaving Clara behind in spite of many
protests, the two girls took the street car down
town. On Fourth Street they found a little store
where Shirley was fortunate enough to find a wig
of the right shade.
</p>
<p>
In a secluded corner in the railroad station, when
there was no one near, Shirley quickly stripped off
her dress and stood revealed in her boy’s clothing.
Donning wig and cap, she handed Mabel the discarded
dress to put into the satchel brought for
that purpose.
</p>
<p>
“Now,” said Shirley, “go back to Clara’s and,
under some pretext or other, wait on the porch for
me after every one has gone to bed. I’ll not come
until I am sure they have all retired.”
</p>
<p>
“All right,” Mabel agreed, “and, Shirley, be very
careful.”
</p>
<p>
“I shall be, never fear,” was the reply, and the
young girl bade her friend good-bye and started for
the rendezvous.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_86'></a>86</span><a name='chXI' id='chXI'></a>CHAPTER XI.—THE MEETING.</h2>
<p>
It was fifteen minutes to six when Shirley reached
the hotel. At the Vine Street entrance she hesitated
a few moments, for now that the time for
action was at hand, she grew nervous. It took
her but an instant to shake off this uneasy feeling,
however, and she entered the hotel boldly.
</p>
<p>
She took a seat in a far corner of the lobby,
where she could see all who came and went without
being too exposed, and then she waited. Six o’clock
came, but there was no sign of Jones.
</p>
<p>
“I reckon he is a little late,” said Shirley to herself.
</p>
<p>
A quarter after six; half-past six and still no
Jones.
</p>
<p>
Shirley arose to go.
</p>
<p>
“I guess he didn’t get my letter in time,” she
said.
</p>
<p>
She made her way to the door. But just as she
would have passed out a hurrying figure bumped
into her. Shirley drew back to let the man pass,
and cried out suddenly:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_87'></a>87</span>
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Jones.”
</p>
<p>
Jones, for it was indeed he, drew back sharply,
and looked closely at Shirley. Then he smiled
slightly.
</p>
<p>
“Smith?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Shirley briefly.
</p>
<p>
“Good. Come with me.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley followed the man back into the hotel.
At the far side of the lobby was a door leading to
the dining-room. Jones led the way inside, Shirley
following close at his heels.
</p>
<p>
He selected a small table at the far end of the
dining-room, and the two sat down.
</p>
<p>
“We can talk here undisturbed,” said Jones.
</p>
<p>
Their orders given, Jones leaned back in his
chair.
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t have recognized you,” he said, looking
at Shirley sharply.
</p>
<p>
“I was beginning to think you would not come,”
said Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“My train was late,” Jones responded. “I had
to hustle to get here as soon as I did.”
</p>
<p>
He was silent for some moments. Shirley said
nothing, waiting for Jones to open the conversation.
</p>
<p>
“So,” said the man after the food had been set
before them, “you have decided to accept my offer,
eh?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_88'></a>88</span>
</p>
<p>
Shirley thought it good policy not to appear too
anxious.
</p>
<p>
“It all depends upon what you want me to do,”
she replied.
</p>
<p>
Jones looked at her long and carefully.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” he said at length, “I’ll tell you. You
understand, of course, that it will not be healthy
for you to repeat anything I may say?”
</p>
<p>
Shirley nodded assent.
</p>
<p>
“And that if you play me false, you will get
the worst of it?”
</p>
<p>
Again Shirley nodded.
</p>
<p>
“Good. I don’t need to go into details, but what
I want is this: I want you to see that Gabriel does
not win the Derby. In other words, I want you to
‘pull’ him.”
</p>
<p>
“Pull him!” echoed Shirley.
</p>
<p>
This was a language she did not understand.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Surely you know what pulling means?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, no, not exactly,” replied Shirley hesitatingly.
</p>
<p>
“What kind of a jockey do you call yourself?”
sneered Jones. “By pulling I mean holding Gabriel
back so that some other horse may finish ahead
of him.”
</p>
<p>
“I see,” said Shirley. “And have you selected
the horse that is to win the race?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Jupiter, owned by the bookmakers.”
</p>
<p>
“And that is all you want me to do?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_89'></a>89</span>
</p>
<p>
“That is all.”
</p>
<p>
“And you are willing to pay me $500 for that?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley was silent, apparently considering. Jones
waited perhaps five minutes for her to speak, and
then said:
</p>
<p>
“Well, what do you say?”
</p>
<p>
Shirley rose from her chair.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll do it,” she said quietly. “When do I get the
money?”
</p>
<p>
“After the Derby.”
</p>
<p>
“Very well,” said Shirley, “you may count upon
me to do my best.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s all, then,” said Jones, also rising. “I
will make it a point to see you just before the race
starts.”
</p>
<p>
He walked to the door with the supposed traitorous
jockey. There Shirley stopped for another
word.
</p>
<p>
“One thing,” she said. “Send me no messages
and do not come to see me. It would be too risky.”
</p>
<p>
“Right you are,” said Jones. “Good-bye.”
</p>
<p>
He turned on his heel and left without another
word. Shirley also made her way from the hotel.
Her eyes fell upon a clock in a window.
</p>
<p>
“Eight o’clock,” she said. “I can’t go to Clara’s
yet. They will all see me. What shall I do to pass
the time?”
</p>
<p>
She debated the point at length.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_90'></a>90</span>
</p>
<p>
“I’ll stop in this drug store and have an ice cream
soda, anyhow,” she finally decided.
</p>
<p>
This refreshment disposed of, Shirley reached
for her purse. For the moment she forgot she was
dressed in boys’ clothes, but in an instant she remembered,
and thrust her hand in her pocket; and
she drew it out with a cry of dismay.
</p>
<p>
She had forgotten to put her purse in her pocket,
and she had no money, and there was the ice cream
soda to be paid for.
</p>
<p>
The man at the cashier’s desk was looking at her
suspiciously. Shirley, glancing up, caught the look.
Again she made a desperate search of her pockets,
but the search was futile. There was no money
there.
</p>
<p>
Shirley turned to the cashier.
</p>
<p>
“I’m sorry,” she said quietly, “but I have misplaced
my money. I’ll have to ask you to wait till
to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>
“Misplaced your money, eh,” sneered the man,
looking at Shirley’s shabby attire. “I suppose, when
you came in here, you were sure you had money,
were you?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course I was,” said Shirley indignantly.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’m not so sure. I’ve seen your kind before.
I guess I had better call an officer.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley became greatly frightened.
</p>
<p>
“Please don’t do that,” she said, in great alarm.
“I’ll pay you to-morrow sure. Honestly I will.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_91'></a>91</span>
</p>
<p>
“That’s an old one,” said the cashier. “Either
you will dig up ten cents right now or I shall call
a policeman.”
</p>
<p>
“But I haven’t ten cents,” said Shirley tearfully.
</p>
<p>
“Then I shall call the officer,” said the cashier,
and reached for the desk telephone.
</p>
<p>
Shirley, badly frightened, did not know what
to do. She did not know that the cashier, thinking
she was trying to defraud him, would not have
called the police, but was simply trying to frighten
her into paying.
</p>
<p>
But help came from an unexpected source.
</p>
<p>
A young man who had been an interested listener
to this conversation suddenly stepped forward,
and laid a dime on the counter.
</p>
<p>
“There is your ten cents,” he said quietly to the
cashier. “Let the boy alone. Can’t you see he is
honest?”
</p>
<p>
“About as honest as the rest of ’em,” sneered the
cashier, picking up the dime.
</p>
<p>
Shirley turned to her benefactor.
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, sir,” she said earnestly. “I’ll see
that you get it back.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, all right,” said the young man with a laugh,
“but I guess it won’t break me if I don’t.”
</p>
<p>
It was plain to Shirley that he never expected to
have it returned, and upon that instant she decided
that he should.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_92'></a>92</span>
</p>
<p>
“If you will give me your card,” she said, “I
shall see that you get it back to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>
The young man smiled at her.
</p>
<p>
“Well, if you insist,” he said, with a smile, and
extracted a card from his pocket, and handed it
to Shirley.
</p>
<p>
Shirley stuffed it into her pocket.
</p>
<p>
“Thank you very much,” she said quietly. “Good-bye.”
</p>
<p>
She left the store and walked down the street.
It was now half-past eight, as Shirley saw by the
street clock.
</p>
<p>
“I guess I might as well go home and risk being
seen,” she told herself.
</p>
<p>
She stopped at the next corner and hailed an approaching
car. She was just about to step aboard,
when she suddenly remembered she did not have
carfare. She stepped back abruptly. The conductor
rang the bell angrily, and the car went on.
</p>
<p>
“My gracious,” said Shirley to herself, “it’s a
long way to Walnut Hills but I guess I shall have
to walk it. I wonder if I can find the way?”
</p>
<p>
She stood still for several minutes.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” she said at last, “I might as well start.
There is no use standing here. I’ll just have to follow
the car line, and ask if I lose my way.”
</p>
<p>
First she made her way to Fourth and Walnut
Streets, and then she started off in the direction
taken by a Walnut Hills car.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_93'></a>93</span>
</p>
<p>
She was forced to ask directions several times
before she got very far, but nevertheless she made
fair progress. She was just congratulating herself
upon her good fortune in getting out of so serious
a predicament so easily, when something else happened.
</p>
<p>
Around the corner, suddenly, came a crowd of
boys, their ages ranging from twelve to fifteen.
This part of the city was by no means the best,
and Shirley thanked her stars that she was attired
in boy’s clothes.
</p>
<p>
But her attire was not to stand her in good stead
now.
</p>
<p>
The crowd of boys came on at a run, and when
directly in front of Shirley the leaders stopped.
</p>
<p>
“Look here, fellows,” said one of them. “Here
is a poor kid all by himself. He looks big enough
to fight. Shall we take him along?”
</p>
<p>
“Sure,” came from the rest.
</p>
<p>
The boy who had first spoken grabbed Shirley
by the arm, and shook him.
</p>
<p>
“Can you fight?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
Shirley again was almost in tears.
</p>
<p>
“No,” she quavered.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” came the reply, “you’ll have to fight. We
are going after the Eighteenth Street gang and we
need reinforcements. You will help. But if you
don’t fight, well, you’ll get the worst of it anyhow.
Come on.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_94'></a>94</span>
</p>
<p>
Shirley hung back, but it was no use. A boy
grabbed her by either arm, and she found herself
being hurried along.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll fix ’em this time,” was the cry of the
boys.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_95'></a>95</span><a name='chXII' id='chXII'></a>CHAPTER XII.—SHIRLEY FINDS A CHAMPION.</h2>
<p>
Shirley realized that she was in a serious predicament.
Guarded as she was, she had no hope
of escape, and she realized that the situation was
rapidly growing worse. Every step forward took
her that much nearer danger. Still she did not wish
to betray that she was a girl, so she wiped the tears
from her eyes with a quick brush of her sleeve
and moved along with the rest without resistance.
</p>
<p>
Two blocks further on the gang came to an abrupt
stop, and the two who seemed to be the leaders conferred.
Then, at an order from one, the gang divided
into two parts. Shirley found herself under
the direction of a boy whom his companions called
Dick.
</p>
<p>
“You go around that way with your fellows,
Tom,” said Dick, waving his arm to the left, “and
I’ll go this way. We’ll catch ’em between us and
pay ’em back for what they did to Ed and Joe yesterday.”
</p>
<p>
The boys moved off in two different directions.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_96'></a>96</span>
Shirley found herself right behind Dick and she
eyed him curiously. Young though he was, the
girl saw that he was strong and powerful. An
athlete herself, she could not but admire the easy
swing of his shoulders as he trotted on ahead, his
calm assurance and the confidence with which he
gave his orders. Shirley decided to stay as close
to him as possible.
</p>
<p>
And now turning another corner, Dick shouted:
</p>
<p>
“There they are, fellows! At ’em!”
</p>
<p>
There was a loud cheer, and from far down the
street came its echo, as Tom and his crowd attacked
the enemy from the rear.
</p>
<p>
And now Shirley caught her first view of the
enemy.
</p>
<p>
Halfway down the block, caught between two
fires as they were, the enemy, perhaps twenty of
them, was preparing to give battle. Shirley could
see that they had picked up whatever they could
lay hands upon, and were awaiting the attackers
to come within range.
</p>
<p>
Shirley shuddered, but kept close behind Dick.
</p>
<p>
“Look out!” cried Dick, and darted to one side.
</p>
<p>
Shirley did likewise, and a rock skimmed past
her. There was a howl of pain from further back,
and Shirley knew that one of the crowd had been
hit.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll make ’em pay for that,” cried Dick, and
in spite of the fusillade of missiles being hurled at
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_97'></a>97</span>
them, he bore down upon the enemy at top speed.
</p>
<p>
For an instant Shirley hesitated. Here, she
thought, might be a chance for her to make her
escape. She turned, but as she did so the others
surrounded her and she was forced to go on whether
or not she wished it.
</p>
<p>
The two factions came together with great force.
They were too closely entwined to permit of the
hurling of rocks now. It was hard to distinguish
friend from foe.
</p>
<p>
Shirley found herself in the midst of a struggling,
striking mass. Wherever she turned she saw nothing
but flying fists. One of the enemy struck her
a glancing blow on the arm. Shirley became angry.
</p>
<p>
Stepping quickly forward she struck the boy a
resounding smack with her open hand.
</p>
<p>
Dick, who happened to be close to her at that
moment, noted this with a grin.
</p>
<p>
“Hit ’em with your fist,” he called. “It won’t
do any good to slap ’em.”
</p>
<p>
But this Shirley could not do. So there she
stood while the struggling mass fought around
her. How long the street fight continued, Shirley
did not know, but it came to an end suddenly.
</p>
<p>
From far down the street came the single sharp
blast of a whistle. Immediately the struggling combatants
dropped their fists and took to their heels.
</p>
<p>
“Police,” was the cry that went up.
</p>
<p>
Three minutes later the street was deserted. Both
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_98'></a>98</span>
factions had fled, and when the guardians of the
law appeared upon the scene there was nothing to
give evidence of the struggle that had raged a few
moments before.
</p>
<p>
Shirley had fled with the others, still keeping as
close to Dick as possible. Round corner after corner
she followed him, for she was keen enough to
know that in this way lay safety, while, should
she go her own way, she was likely to fall into
the hands of the law; and, in her present attire, she
had no desire to do this.
</p>
<p>
But finally the half a dozen who had fled in
the same direction as Dick and Shirley came to a
halt. They stood panting and gasping.
</p>
<p>
Then one boy suddenly came up to Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“I told you to fight,” he said. “You didn’t do
it. I watched you. Now I am going to make you
fight.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley shrank back.
</p>
<p>
“Put up your fists,” called the boy.
</p>
<p>
The others gathered round to see the fun.
</p>
<p>
“He’s a coward,” they said. “He’s afraid to
fight. Hit him anyhow.”
</p>
<p>
They surrounded Shirley with angry gestures.
</p>
<p>
It was at this moment that Dick interfered.
</p>
<p>
“Let the kid alone,” he said quietly, moving into
the midst of the others. “If he doesn’t want to
fight, he doesn’t have to. Maybe he’s not the fighting
kind. Let him alone.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_99'></a>99</span>
</p>
<p>
There was an angry growl from the others.
</p>
<p>
“I say he has got to fight,” said one.
</p>
<p>
“And I say he hasn’t,” cried Dick. “Who is the
leader of this crowd, anyhow?”
</p>
<p>
“We wouldn’t have much trouble finding a better
one,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
“Right you are, Ned,” said several voices at once.
</p>
<p>
“Pick on me if you want to,” said Dick, “but let
the kid alone.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley shrank close to him, for she knew that
in him lay her hope of safety. Dick put a hand
on her shoulder.
</p>
<p>
“It’s all right, kid,” he said. “They won’t bother
you.”
</p>
<p>
“Won’t we?” exclaimed one.
</p>
<p>
He stepped suddenly forward, and before Dick
could prevent him, aimed a blow at Shirley. Unconsciously
the girl ducked, and the blow barely
grazed her head, carrying away her hat, and worst
of all, her boy’s wig.
</p>
<p>
Her long hair came tumbling down.
</p>
<p>
The boy who had struck at her started back in
surprise.
</p>
<p>
“A girl!” he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
Shirley broke into tears.
</p>
<p>
Dick had taken in the situation at a glance. He
stepped quickly forward and with a single blow of
his left fist knocked the boy who had struck Shirley
to the ground.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_100'></a>100</span>
</p>
<p>
Then the others jumped upon him.
</p>
<p>
Shirley’s tears stopped instantly and she watched
the fight in wide-eyed amazement. Dick, bigger
and stronger than the rest, was giving a good account
of himself, but it was plain to Shirley that
the weight of numbers must tell in the end.
</p>
<p>
Two boys went down before their leader’s fists,
but they were up again in an instant and fighting
back desperately. One attacked him from behind,
but with a quick kick Dick shook himself free.
Picking his nearest opponent up bodily, he hurled
him full in the faces of the others; and they gave
ground.
</p>
<p>
But only for a minute. Then they sprang forward
again. Dick found himself hard pressed on
all sides. He reeled under a blow that caught him
on the point of the chin, and before he could recover,
two stinging blows struck him in the jaw.
</p>
<p>
He made one last desperate effort, throwing
himself upon his opponents, but the effort was vain.
</p>
<p>
Stooping, one of the boys picked up a rock, and
waiting an opportunity jumped in quickly and struck
him in the back of the head.
</p>
<p>
Dick uttered a slight groan, stumbled and fell
almost at Shirley’s feet.
</p>
<p>
The girl uttered a cry of horror. The other boys,
startled for the moment at the outcome, hung back,
then advanced toward their fallen leader. Believing
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_101'></a>101</span>
that they were about to do him further harm,
Shirley took the responsibility upon herself.
</p>
<p>
Her nervousness, fright and indecision left her
instantly. She reached quickly in her coat pocket
and whipped forth her little revolver, which she
aimed at the crowd of young ruffians with steady
hand.
</p>
<p>
“Stand back!” she cried.
</p>
<p>
The ruffians hesitated.
</p>
<p>
“Look here,” began one, advancing a step.
</p>
<p>
“Take my advice and stay where you are,” said
Shirley quietly. “I don’t want to hurt you, but if
any one of you come a single step nearer I’ll shoot.”
</p>
<p>
The crowd drew back, and stood silently watching
her.
</p>
<p>
Laying the revolver upon the sidewalk close beside
her, Shirley raised Dick’s head to her knee.
Then she sought to stop the flow of blood from the
wound with her handkerchief.
</p>
<p>
Dick stirred slightly, and a faint breath shivered
through his lips.
</p>
<p>
“What’s happened?” he gasped.
</p>
<p>
“Lie still!” commanded Shirley. “Your head is
badly cut.”
</p>
<p>
Dick shook off her detaining hand, and rose slowly.
He felt his wound, and then said:
</p>
<p>
“Which one of you fellows hit me with a rock?”
</p>
<p>
Not a sound came from the crowd. Dick stepped
forward.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_102'></a>102</span>
</p>
<p>
“Better tell me now,” he said, “for I’ll find out
sometime, and when I do somebody will be well
thrashed.”
</p>
<p>
A boy stepped forward.
</p>
<p>
“I did it,” he said. “But now I’m sorry!”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’ll attend to you later,” said Dick.
</p>
<p>
He turned to Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“What are you doing out at this hour, and dressed
this way?”
</p>
<p>
In a few words Shirley told him enough of her
trouble to satisfy his curiosity.
</p>
<p>
“The best thing you can do is to get home at
once,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know the way now,” said Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Where do you live?”
</p>
<p>
Shirley told him.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll take you home,” said Dick quietly, “if you
don’t mind my walking along with you.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you,” said Shirley. “Of course I don’t
mind.”
</p>
<p>
Dick turned to his friends.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll see you fellows later,” he said significantly.
“We’ll talk this matter over when there are no
girls around. Get out of here now.”
</p>
<p>
With a crestfallen air they obeyed.
</p>
<p>
Dick turned once more to Shirley. “Come,” he
said.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_103'></a>103</span><a name='chXIII' id='chXIII'></a>CHAPTER XIII.—MR. WILLING IS PUZZLED.</h2>
<p>
It was late when they neared Clara Morton’s
home. As they approached quietly, a figure ran
from the porch to meet them. It was Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Shirley,” she cried, “I was so afraid that something
had happened to you. I have been waiting
here for more than an hour.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, something did happen,” said Shirley. “I’ll
tell you about it when we get upstairs.”
</p>
<p>
“Come on, then,” said Mabel, “but be careful.
I told Clara you probably wouldn’t be home until
in the morning, and no one here must see you in
that costume.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley turned to say good-bye to Dick, but there
was no Dick. His duty done, he had not waited
for thanks.
</p>
<p>
Shirley was disappointed.
</p>
<p>
“I would like to have said good-bye to him,” she
told herself.
</p>
<p>
Silently the two girls made their way up the
stairs, and reached their room without being discovered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_104'></a>104</span>
</p>
<p>
Mabel insisted upon an immediate account of
Shirley’s adventures and the latter gave full details.
</p>
<p>
“You see,” she concluded, “it was all your fault.
Why didn’t you remind me of my purse?”
</p>
<p>
“That’s right, blame me,” said Mabel. “I think
you’ve had some jolly fun.”
</p>
<p>
“It depends on how you look at it,” drawled
Shirley. “Oh, but I’m tired. Let’s get to sleep.”
</p>
<p>
The next two days, Saturday and Sunday, the
girls spent quietly in their friend’s home, only going
out twice. One trip was to the theater, and
the other to church on Sunday morning.
</p>
<p>
Early Monday morning found them on the train.
</p>
<p>
A young man boarded the train at Cynthiana,
who attracted Shirley’s attention at once. There
was something familiar about him, but for the moment
she could not place him. Looking in her
handbag for her ticket, she accidentally drew forth
a card, which she glanced at in surprise.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Leonard Wolfe,” it read.
</p>
<p>
“I wonder,” she murmured, and then it all came
to her in a flash.
</p>
<p>
“The card of the young man who came to my
aid in the drugstore,” she said, passing it to Mabel.
“That reminds me, I forgot to send the ten
cents.”
</p>
<p>
“I reckon he won’t miss it,” said Mabel, as she
returned the card.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_105'></a>105</span>
</p>
<p>
The young man who had just gotten on the train,
came through the aisle. He dropped his suitcase
in the seat across from the girls, and sat down.
</p>
<p>
Shirley noticed that from time to time he glanced
at her. To herself she said, “His face is familiar.
Where have I seen him before?”
</p>
<p>
And then she remembered.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Wolfe!” she exclaimed to herself.
</p>
<p>
She whispered to Mabel, and the latter, of course,
glanced across. As she did so she encountered
the young man’s smiling eyes.
</p>
<p>
The young man arose directly and spoke to Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Surely I have met you somewhere,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps it’s my twin brother you met,” said
Shirley, with a faint smile. “We look very much
alike.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps that’s it,” returned the young man.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” continued Shirley, “my twin brother is
often getting into scrapes, and I have to help him
out. He told me that the other day he almost fell
into the hands of the police, because he didn’t have
money to pay for a soda he bought in a drugstore
in Cincinnati. Some stranger came to his aid and
paid the dime. I don’t believe he returned it,
either.”
</p>
<p>
The young man had looked at Shirley in surprise
during this recital, and then he said quietly:
</p>
<p>
“No, he didn’t!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_106'></a>106</span>
</p>
<p>
“How do you know?” queried Shirley in well
simulated surprise.
</p>
<p>
“Because I happen to be the fellow who paid it.”
</p>
<p>
Before answering Shirley reached for her handbag
and took out a card. She gazed at it long and
earnestly.
</p>
<p>
“Is your name Mr. Wolfe?” she asked finally.
</p>
<p>
“Why, yes,” exclaimed the young man. “Why?”
</p>
<p>
“Nothing, only my brother, in telling me of the
trouble, showed me your card and I didn’t give
it back.”
</p>
<p>
She drew a dime from her purse and extended
it to the young man.
</p>
<p>
“Here is your ten cents,” she said.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Wolfe protested.
</p>
<p>
“Let your brother pay his own debts,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“No,” said Shirley, “I insist. You see, my
brother and I are such close relations that I almost
feel I owe you this myself.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, if you insist,” said the young man.
</p>
<p>
He took the dime and dropped it in his pocket.
</p>
<p>
“May I ask where you are going?”
</p>
<p>
“Home,” said Shirley briefly, for she wished to
end the conversation, considering now that she had
repaid her debt.
</p>
<p>
“I see,” smiled Mr. Wolfe; “and would you mind
telling me just about where that is.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll tell you this much,” said Shirley. “It’s about
three miles from Paris, on the Bethlehem pike.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_107'></a>107</span>
</p>
<p>
The young man uttered an exclamation of surprise.
</p>
<p>
“I wonder if you know a Mr. Willing, who must
live near you?”
</p>
<p>
“He is my father,” returned Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“You don’t say so! I am in luck, for I am going
now to Willing’s place.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley felt frightened.
</p>
<p>
“You are?” she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“On business?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, no, not exactly. You see, Mr. Willing and
my father are old friends. Your father has often
asked my father to stop and see him, and as I was
near, I felt anxious to call.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley held out her hand.
</p>
<p>
“I know you now,” she said. “At first I didn’t
associate you with the Mr. Wolfe of whom father
speaks so often, his old college friend.”
</p>
<p>
“I am the son of his old friend,” said Mr. Wolfe.
</p>
<p>
“You will be very welcome,” said Shirley.
</p>
<p>
She introduced him to Mabel, who had been much
interested in their talk.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Wolfe said after a few minutes, “I knew,
of course, that Mr. Willing had a daughter, but
I had never heard of twins.”
</p>
<p>
“Twins!” repeated Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Yes; this troublesome brother of yours.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley blushed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_108'></a>108</span>
</p>
<p>
“I—we—he,” she stammered.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Wolfe looked at her for a few moments,
then a smile spread over his face.
</p>
<p>
“I see,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“You see what?” demanded Shirley anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“The joke,” replied young Wolfe drily.
</p>
<p>
Shirley blushed, and hid her head in her hands.
</p>
<p>
“Have no fear,” said the young man, “I shall
say nothing about it. If you care to tell me why
you masqueraded, I shall be honored, but I shall
not press you for an explanation; and I will never
mention it.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you,” said Shirley. “There is no reason
why I cannot tell you, if you will promise to
keep the secret.”
</p>
<p>
“I promise,” said he.
</p>
<p>
Shirley then gave him an account of her adventures
and their cause. When she finished, young
Wolfe looked at her in undisguised admiration.
</p>
<p>
“By Jove!” he exclaimed. “You are plucky.
And you are doing all this for the boy you call
Jimmy Smith?”
</p>
<p>
“And my father too,” said Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Wolfe, “you are indeed a brave
girl, and I am proud to know you.”
</p>
<p>
The train was now whistling for Paris.
</p>
<p>
“You will, of course, ride out with us,” said
Shirley.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_109'></a>109</span>
</p>
<p>
“I shall be pleased,” returned the young man, with
a bow.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing met them as they stepped from the
train.
</p>
<p>
Then he saw the young man. He looked at him
long and earnestly, and then before either of the
girls could speak, he said:
</p>
<p>
“Surely this is Leonard Wolfe?”
</p>
<p>
“I am,” said the young man, smiling and extending
his hand.
</p>
<p>
“I thought I could not be mistaken,” said Mr.
Willing. “You are your father all over again.”
</p>
<p>
He turned to Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Wolfe,” he said, “allow me to introduce
you to my daughter.” He turned to Mabel,
“and——”
</p>
<p>
“We have already met, Daddy,” laughed Shirley.
“Mr. Wolfe made himself known to us on
the train.”
</p>
<p>
“But how——” began Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“Never mind now, Daddy,” said Shirley. “It’s
a long story.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” muttered Mr. Willing to himself, “all
right, but the young people now-a-days aren’t like
they were in my day.”
</p>
<p>
Then he climbed into the large automobile and
Frank started it.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_110'></a>110</span><a name='chXIV' id='chXIV'></a>CHAPTER XIV.—JIMMY DECIDES.</h2>
<p>
“Somebody’s coming, Dad.”
</p>
<p>
It was Shirley who spoke. Mr. Willing looked
up from his morning paper and turned his eyes
toward the distant pike. Between the fields of tall
hemp, a quarter of a mile away, a solitary horseman
was approaching.
</p>
<p>
“Can’t make him out from here,” said Mr. Willing,
shading his eyes. “I wonder who he is?”
</p>
<p>
“You’ll know soon enough, Dad,” laughed Shirley.
“What’s the use of wondering?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, set out a box of cigars,” said Mr. Willing,
“and make a pitcher of lemonade. He’ll be thirsty
after his ride.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley went towards the pantry, and returned
with the lemonade just as the rider dismounted.
After a glance she started back in surprise.
</p>
<p>
“Jones,” she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
For the rider was indeed Mr. Jones, the man
whom Shirley had travelled to Cincinnati to see.
</p>
<p>
Shirley ran around the house to where Mabel and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_111'></a>111</span>
young Wolfe were swinging in the hammock, in
the shade of a giant elm.
</p>
<p>
“Jones is here,” she cried breathlessly, “what shall
we do?”
</p>
<p>
“There is nothing to worry about,” said Wolfe.
“He will try no foolishness here, I’m sure.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s not that I am afraid of,” returned Shirley,
“but if he should talk to Jimmy he is likely to find
out that he has been fooled.”
</p>
<p>
“We must prevent their meeting,” said Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“But how?” demanded Shirley, in excited tones.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll see what can be done,” said Wolfe.
</p>
<p>
He arose and went quickly to the stable, where
he engaged Jimmy in conversation. Jimmy should
not leave his sight until Jones had taken his departure,
Wolfe said to himself.
</p>
<p>
Meantime Mr. Willing and Jones were holding a
friendly conversation on the front porch. Shirley
and Mabel strolled into the parlor, where, through
the open window, they could hear all that was being
said.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir,” said Jones, “it is regarded as a forgone
conclusion that Gabriel will win the Derby.
I’m backing him myself. Jupiter is the only other
entry that has a chance.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m glad to hear you say that,” returned Mr.
Willing. “I am counting on Gabriel winning. If
he loses—well, I don’t mind telling you, it will
hurt.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_112'></a>112</span>
</p>
<p>
“I suppose you are backing him strong?”
</p>
<p>
“No,” said Mr. Willing, “I’m not. To tell the
truth, I am through betting.”
</p>
<p>
“Through betting?” asked Jones, in greatest surprise.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I have promised my daughter.”
</p>
<p>
“I see,” said Jones, and changed the subject. “I
wonder if I could get a look at Gabriel?”
</p>
<p>
“Why, certainly. I’ll have some one call Jimmy,
and he will show you the horse.”
</p>
<p>
“Thanks,” said Jones, and sat back to wait.
</p>
<p>
In response to the message delivered to an old
negro, Jimmy came to the house. He started a
little at sight of Jones, but recovered quickly. Wolfe
followed him.
</p>
<p>
“Jimmy,” said Mr. Willing, “Mr. Jones would
like to have a look at the winner of the coming
Derby. Take him to Gabriel.”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir,” said Jimmy.
</p>
<p>
He walked away, Jones following him. Wolfe
would have accompanied him, but Mr. Willing
hailed him.
</p>
<p>
“Young man,” he said, “I wish you would walk
up to the pike and see if there is any mail in the
box. I am expecting an important letter.”
</p>
<p>
Wolfe was at a loss what to do. To leave Jimmy
and Jones alone might work mischief, but Mr.
Willing was not a man who could be put off.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_113'></a>113</span>
</p>
<p>
“There’s no hope for it,” said Wolfe to himself,
and set off toward the pike.
</p>
<p>
Shirley and Mabel had overheard the conversation.
</p>
<p>
“Come,” said the former, “we must at least find
out what Jones says to Jimmy.”
</p>
<p>
They left the house silently, and as silently followed
the two to the stable. They managed to
crawl into the stall next to Gabriel’s without being
discovered.
</p>
<p>
“Well, how is everything?” asked Jones.
</p>
<p>
“All right, sir,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
“How’s Gabriel, in condition?”
</p>
<p>
“Perfectly fit, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Good; and do you think you can ‘pull’ him without
causing talk? It must be neatly done, you know,
for should the judges suspect anything they will
disqualify the winner.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?”
</p>
<p>
“Just what I say. Surely you haven’t forgotten
our conversation in Cincinnati?”
</p>
<p>
“Cincinnati?” and Jimmy’s blank look showed
surprise.
</p>
<p>
“Yes; the little talk we had about letting Jupiter
win.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what you are talking about,” protested
Jimmy.
</p>
<p>
Jones stepped back and looked at Jimmy sternly.
</p>
<p>
“What are you trying to do, make a fool of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_114'></a>114</span>
me?” he asked. “I suppose you’ll tell me in a minute
you didn’t see me in Cincinnati.”
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t,” replied Jimmy.
</p>
<p>
Jones gave a long and expressive whistle.
</p>
<p>
“I see,” he said. “Your conscience has troubled
you, eh? You are going back on your bargain.”
</p>
<p>
“I made no bargain with you,” said Jimmy angrily.
</p>
<p>
“You didn’t? I suppose you didn’t write me to
meet you in Cincinnati? And I suppose that while
there you didn’t accept an offer of $500 to pull Gabriel
in the Derby?”
</p>
<p>
“I did not.”
</p>
<p>
Jones took a step forward and laid an angry hand
on Jimmy’s shoulder.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you lie to me, you little shrimp,” he
snarled. “You have made the bargain, and you’ll
live up to it or I’ll know the reason why.”
</p>
<p>
Jimmy jerked away angrily.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what you are talking about,” he
exclaimed. “I made no bargain with you. I never
saw you but once before. Now you had better get
out of this stable or I shall call Mr. Willing and
tell him all I know about you.”
</p>
<p>
Jones tried to temporize. He could not disbelieve
the evidence of his own eyes, and he naturally
concluded that Jimmy was feigning ignorance for a
purpose.
</p>
<p>
“I see,” he exclaimed. “You are a shrewd little
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_115'></a>115</span>
chap. Holding out for more money, eh? Well, I’ll
tell you what I’ll do. I’ll make it $750. What do
you say to that, eh? See that Gabriel loses the race
and I’ll give you $750. Come, what do you say?”
</p>
<p>
Jimmy hesitated.
</p>
<p>
“That’s a whole lot of money,” persisted Jones.
</p>
<p>
Jimmy brought his hands together suddenly.
</p>
<p>
“Not for a million!” he declared stoutly.
</p>
<p>
Again Jones became angry and, stretching forth
a strong hand suddenly, took Jimmy by the shoulder
and shook him.
</p>
<p>
“You little whipper-snapper!” he said. “What do
you mean by trifling with me like that? I’ll show
you.”
</p>
<p>
He drew back a huge fist, and in another second
would have sent it crashing into Jimmy’s face.
</p>
<p>
But, at that, Shirley sprang from the stall. Her
eyes flashed, and anger crimsoned her cheeks. In
her hand she carried a short whip she had picked
up in the stall.
</p>
<p>
She rushed upon Jones.
</p>
<p>
“You great big coward!” said Shirley.
</p>
<p>
Jones, startled, turned just in time to catch the
whip across his face. Shirley swung it with all her
strength. Jones clapped his hands to his face and
uttered a moan of pain.
</p>
<p>
Then he turned slowly and, as he removed his
hand, a huge welt showed where the whip had found
its mark.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_116'></a>116</span>
</p>
<p>
“You shall answer for that blow,” he said through
his teeth. “You and your father both. I’ll break
him, if it takes every cent I have.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley eyed him scornfully.
</p>
<p>
“Leave here at once,” she commanded, “or I shall
tell my father and he will have the niggers drive
you off the place.”
</p>
<p>
Jones took a sudden step toward her. Shirley
leaped back and again raised the whip.
</p>
<p>
“One step nearer,” she said quietly, “and I’ll use
the whip again.”
</p>
<p>
She drew herself up, and, extending a hand
toward the door, cried:
</p>
<p>
“Go!”
</p>
<p>
With an evil smile on his lips, Jones bowed to
her scornfully, and backed through the door. Then
Shirley dropped the whip, and walked over to Jimmy,
who was sitting upon the floor, his face in his
hands.
</p>
<p>
“Never mind, Jimmy,” she said. “It was a great
temptation and you are noble to refuse it.”
</p>
<p>
Jimmy raised his head.
</p>
<p>
“Then it was you whom Jones saw in Cincinnati?”
he asked.
</p>
<p>
Shirley nodded.
</p>
<p>
“I knew it,” replied Jimmy. “When he was so
persistent, I knew that he was not lying. Now I
understand. Then you must have overheard our
first conversation?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_117'></a>117</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I did.”
</p>
<p>
“And why didn’t you tell your father?”
</p>
<p>
“Because,” said Shirley slowly, “I knew that I
could save you from yourself. I was sure that
you would not fail me, no matter how great the
temptation; but I knew father would not believe
that, if he once learned you had even considered
the offer.”
</p>
<p>
“Miss Shirley,” said Jimmy brokenly, “I can
never thank you enough. Never will I be tempted
again. Never!”
</p>
<p>
“I am sure of it,” replied Shirley, “and for that
reason I shall say nothing about it to Dad.”
</p>
<p>
“You will find in the future that I am to be trusted,”
said Jimmy simply.
</p>
<p>
“I am sure of it, Jimmy,” Shirley answered
quietly.
</p>
<p>
She held out her hand to him.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_118'></a>118</span><a name='chXV' id='chXV'></a>CHAPTER XV.—DANGEROUS DAYS.</h2>
<p>
“Jimmy,” said Shirley after supper that evening,
calling the boy to one side, “do you think there is
any danger of any one tampering with Gabriel?”
</p>
<p>
“I hadn’t thought of that, Miss Shirley,” replied
Jimmy in some surprise. “What made you think of
such a thing?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” returned Shirley. “I just happened
to think of it.”
</p>
<p>
“It’s certain,” said Mabel, who came up at that
moment, “that Jones and his friends will take every
means in their power to keep Gabriel from winning
the race.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s just my idea,” said Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Then, in the future,” said Jimmy, “I shall sleep
in the stable.”
</p>
<p>
“But what good will that do?” asked Mabel.
“You are nothing but a boy. You would be no
match for them.”
</p>
<p>
“He shall have my revolver,” suggested Shirley.
She turned to Jimmy. “Can you use it?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_119'></a>119</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” replied the lad.
</p>
<p>
“Good; then I shall get it for you at once.”
</p>
<p>
She left them, and, returning a few moments
later, placed the weapon in Jimmy’s hands.
</p>
<p>
“You will sleep in the stable to-night?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” replied Jimmy. “Jones has not returned
to Louisville, and I believe he might come back
here in the middle of the night.”
</p>
<p>
“So do I,” agreed Shirley.
</p>
<p>
A clock in the house struck eight.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll go to my room and get a few things, and
then return to the stable,” said Jimmy.
</p>
<p>
Coming downstairs, he bade the girls good-night
and went away to his unusual quarters.
</p>
<p>
He went straight to Gabriel’s stall.
</p>
<p>
“I’m going to stay with you to-night, old fellow,”
he said, patting the horse’s head.
</p>
<p>
He climbed up into the loft and threw down an
extra quantity of hay, which he strewed about the
far corner of the stall. On this he spread a blanket
he had brought with him from the house. Then
he extinguished his lantern, and lay down.
</p>
<p>
He did not know how long he had been sleeping
when he was awakened by the sound of the
stall door rattling. Jimmy was a light sleeper. He
sat up quickly and groped for the revolver he had
placed beside him. With the weapon in his hand
he felt more secure.
</p>
<p>
Again the door rattled. Jimmy sat perfectly still.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_120'></a>120</span>
Then there came the sound of low voices outside.
</p>
<p>
Gabriel, awakened at this hour of the night,
whinnied uneasily. Jimmy rose, and slowly and
quietly made his way to the animal’s side, judging
his position by the horse’s breathing.
</p>
<p>
He laid a hand upon the animal’s back, and
Gabriel grew still.
</p>
<p>
Again the door rattled.
</p>
<p>
“Sounds like they were trying to find the lock,”
muttered Jimmy beneath his breath.
</p>
<p>
Still he made no sound.
</p>
<p>
At first he had thought of lighting his lantern,
but second thought had shown him the utter foolishness
of such action. It might frighten away the
men on the outside, or else it would make him an
easy target should they be bent upon serious mischief.
</p>
<p>
“They’ll get the door open in a minute,” the boy
muttered to himself, and he determined to be ready
for them.
</p>
<p>
There was a click, and Jimmy knew that the intruders
had succeeded in forcing the lock. A moment
later the top of the stall door swung inward.
</p>
<p>
The light from a lantern flashed into Jimmy’s
face, and he saw a hand stretched forth to open the
catch of the bottom door. He saw two faces, one
of which he recognized as that of Jones. The
other man he had never seen before.
</p>
<p>
Without stopping to think, Jimmy raised his revolver
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_121'></a>121</span>
and fired, even as Jones, having caught sight
of the lad, uttered an exclamation of dismay.
</p>
<p>
A groan followed the shot and then Jimmy heard
Jones cry:
</p>
<p>
“Quick, Dick! He is armed. Put out the light!”
</p>
<p>
A moment more and complete darkness enveloped
the stable.
</p>
<p>
Jimmy dropped to the ground, keeping as close to
the wall as he could, for he did not want to get
in the way of Gabriel’s hoofs. Frightened by the
shot, Gabriel was rearing and plunging about.
Several times his forefeet came down close to
Jimmy’s head, but fortunately the lad was untouched.
</p>
<p>
Then, as Gabriel became more quiet, Jimmy again
heard a hand fumbling at the catch, and caught a
muttered voice:
</p>
<p>
“If we can get in we’ll soon settle him!”
</p>
<p>
Quickly the lad raised the revolver and fired
twice. There came a howl of anguish, and a voice
cried:
</p>
<p>
“I’m hit.”
</p>
<p>
And then in Jones’ voice:
</p>
<p>
“Some one is coming! Run!”
</p>
<p>
Jimmy heard the two men racing toward the
stable door.
</p>
<p>
Taking care to avoid Gabriel’s hoofs, the lad
leaped to the door and in a moment was on the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_122'></a>122</span>
outside. He paused, however, to shut and lock
the door of the stall.
</p>
<p>
As he reached the other door, he saw two dark
figures spring into the saddles of waiting horses
and go galloping toward the pike.
</p>
<p>
Jimmy sent another shot after them, and turned
as he felt a hand upon his arm.
</p>
<p>
“Here, here, what is the meaning of this?” came
Mr. Willing’s voice.
</p>
<p>
Jimmy turned to face his employer.
</p>
<p>
“Two men just tried to get into Gabriel’s stall,”
he replied.
</p>
<p>
“What!” exclaimed Mr. Willing, starting back
in great surprise.
</p>
<p>
Jimmy repeated his statement.
</p>
<p>
“It’s true, sir,” he added. “I frightened them
away before they could do any damage, and I think
I hit one of them.”
</p>
<p>
“Did you recognize them?”
</p>
<p>
“One of them,” was the lad’s reply.
</p>
<p>
“Who was he?”
</p>
<p>
“Mr. Jones, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“You mean the man who was here to see me to-day?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Come to the house with me,” said Mr. Willing
sternly. “There is more to this matter than appears
on the surface. How did you happen to be
sleeping in the stable?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_123'></a>123</span>
</p>
<p>
“It was Miss Shirley, sir, who first thought that
Gabriel might come to harm.”
</p>
<p>
“And what does she know about this matter?”
</p>
<p>
“She knows all about it, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll wake her now and find out,” declared Mr.
Willing.
</p>
<p>
But there was no need to call Shirley, nor Mabel,
either, for that matter. Both girls had heard the
sound of the shots, and had immediately arisen
from bed and begun to dress. Mabel’s father also
had been aroused and now came from the house
with them. As Jimmy and Mr. Willing approached,
Mr. Ashton called out:
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter, Willing?”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing explained in a few quick sentences.
Then he turned to his daughter.
</p>
<p>
“Come to my room,” he said. “I want to ask
you some questions.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley, Mabel, and Mr. Ashton followed Mr.
Willing and Jimmy.
</p>
<p>
“Now, Shirley,” said Mr. Willing, sternly, “tell
me all that you know about this matter.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley hesitated, but knew well it was useless.
So, starting with the first conversation she had
overheard between Jones and Jimmy, she told it
all. At the conclusion of her story, Mr. Willing
turned a grave look upon Jimmy.
</p>
<p>
“So you thought of selling me out, eh?”
</p>
<p>
Jimmy hung his head but made no reply.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_124'></a>124</span>
</p>
<p>
“Daddy,” interrupted Shirley, “he did no such
thing. He was just tempted; that’s all.”
</p>
<p>
“That he should even listen to the voice of the
tempter is enough for me,” said Mr. Willing.
“Smith, you may pack your clothes and leave the
first thing in the morning.”
</p>
<p>
Jimmy bowed his head, and started to leave the
room.
</p>
<p>
But Shirley ran across the room and stopped
him. Standing between him and the door through
which he would have left, she turned flashing eyes
upon her father.
</p>
<p>
“Shame upon you,” she said, pointing an accusing
finger at him. “But for Jimmy, there is no
telling what might have happened to Gabriel this
night. You know as well as I do that Jimmy is
perfectly honest. You shan’t drive him away.”
</p>
<p>
“This is my business,” said Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“And it is mine, too, when I see you doing an
injustice,” replied Shirley. “You would be terribly
sorry in the morning, and I don’t want you to
have any such regrets.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, Miss Shirley,” said Jimmy quietly,
“but it is best that I go.”
</p>
<p>
He moved toward the door.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing’s manner underwent a sudden
change. He turned sharply to Jimmy.
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t you just hear my daughter tell you to
stay?” he demanded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_125'></a>125</span>
</p>
<p>
“Why—why——” began Jimmy.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t stand there and stutter at me,” said Mr.
Willing. “My daughter’s wishes must be obeyed.
What do you mean by trying to run away?”
</p>
<p>
In spite of herself, Shirley was forced to smile.
Mr. Willing noticed this smile, and his face grew
red. He turned again to Jimmy, held out his hand,
and with an effort that was apparent, said:
</p>
<p>
“Jimmy, I beg your pardon. I should have
known better. And forgive my last outburst, too.
If you know how hard it is for me to admit that
I was wrong——”
</p>
<p>
Shirley cut short the rest of the apology by
throwing her arms tightly about her father’s neck.
</p>
<p>
“You are just the best Daddy in the world,”
she said, and gave him a resounding kiss. “I knew
you didn’t mean it.”
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t lose Jimmy for the world,” said Mr.
Willing.
</p>
<p>
At this moment a voice was heard in the hall.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter?” came Leonard Wolfe’s
voice. “I thought I heard a shot.”
</p>
<p>
“The shot,” said Shirley, trying not to smile,
“was fired half an hour ago. You must have
been some distance away if it took this long for
the sound of it to reach you.”
</p>
<p>
Wolfe’s face grew scarlet.
</p>
<p>
“I——” he began, but Shirley interrupted him.
</p>
<p>
“It amounts to nothing,” she said.
</p>

<p>
Jimmy returned to the stable and the rest went
to bed. The night passed without further incident.
</p>
<p>
“Jimmy,” said Mr. Willing the following morning,
“I want you to go to town and buy a new
strong lock, one that cannot be opened from the
outside. We will take no further chances with
Jones and his crowd.”
</p>
<p>
“Very well, sir,” replied the boy, and a half hour
later started on his way, riding one of the horses.
</p>
<p>
The lock purchased, Jimmy, in an unfrequented
part of town, was just preparing to mount for
his homeward journey, when a rude hand was
suddenly laid on his shoulder. Jimmy turned about
quickly and looked into the smiling face of Jones.
</p>
<p>
“You listen to me, son,” said Jones. “We
haven’t been able to get together so far, but I still
think I can make it worth your while to do what
I ask.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t want anything to do with you,” replied
Jimmy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_127'></a>127</span>
</p>
<p>
“Come, now,” said Jones, “don’t be stubborn.
Come with me to where we can talk without fear
of being overheard.”
</p>
<p>
Jimmy hesitated.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps I can learn something,” he told himself.
Aloud he said: “All right.”
</p>
<p>
Jones smiled and led the way down the street.
He turned in the door of what appeared to be a
small hotel, and walked up the steps, Jimmy following.
</p>
<p>
Jones went into a little room, and drew two
chairs up to the table that stood in the center.
</p>
<p>
“Now we can get down to business,” he said.
</p>
<p>
Jimmy sat down, and at that moment the door
opened again and a newcomer appeared upon the
scene. He was young, but large and apparently
very strong. He took a seat at the table without
a word. Then Jimmy noticed for the first time
that his hand was tightly bandaged.
</p>
<p>
“This, Dick,” said Jones to the newcomer and
indicating Jimmy, “is the youngster who put the bullet
through your hand.”
</p>
<p>
Dick jumped up.
</p>
<p>
“Is that so,” he cried. “Then I have a score
to settle with him.”
</p>
<p>
He advanced toward Jimmy, but Jones stopped
him.
</p>
<p>
“Not now,” he said; “at any rate, not if he will
do my bidding.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_128'></a>128</span>
</p>
<p>
Dick sat down again.
</p>
<p>
“Now,” said Jones to Jimmy, “I am going to
give you one last chance to do as I have asked. I
am willing yet to pay the stipulated amount. However,
in case you refuse, I might as well tell you
that I shall use other means. Gabriel must not
win the Derby. In offering you the chance I have,
I am simply taking the easiest way. If you refuse
or I think you will play me false, I shall take other
steps. What do you say?”
</p>
<p>
Jimmy got slowly to his feet.
</p>
<p>
“What other means could you use?” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Plenty,” was the reply. “I might dope the horse,
or shoot him in the leg, or I might even burn the
stable.”
</p>
<p>
Jimmy shuddered.
</p>
<p>
“You wouldn’t do that,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Wouldn’t I?” exclaimed Jones. “Don’t try me.
I will go the limit to make sure that Gabriel doesn’t
win. Now, what is your answer?”
</p>
<p>
Jimmy drew himself up.
</p>
<p>
“The same as it was yesterday,” he said quietly.
“You can’t buy me.”
</p>
<p>
“I can’t, eh?” exclaimed Jones, springing to his
feet. “Let me ask you something. Suppose you
should disappear; who would ride Gabriel in the
Derby?”
</p>
<p>
Jimmy was frightened.
</p>
<p>
“Why, I don’t know,” he replied. “Nobody but
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_129'></a>129</span>
me can ride Gabriel. But why do you ask that?”
</p>
<p>
“Because,” said Jones slowly, “you are about to
disappear.”
</p>
<p>
“Disappear?” repeated Jimmy.
</p>
<p>
“Exactly. I am going to keep you out of sight
until after the race.”
</p>
<p>
Jimmy had surmised what Jones meant at the
other’s first words, but he had feigned ignorance,
playing for time. He had been edging closer and
closer toward the door.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly he darted toward it and laid his hand
on the knob. Jones and his companion were after
him with a shout. Unfortunately for Jimmy, the
door opened inward, and he was forced to step back
to let it swing wide. This caused his undoing.
</p>
<p>
“You would, would you,” exclaimed the villain,
as he drew Jimmy forcibly back into the room.
“Take that, and that, then, and see if it will teach
you I am not to be trifled with.”
</p>
<p>
He cuffed Jimmy’s ears soundly. Then he hurled
the boy into a chair.
</p>
<p>
“You sit there until I tell you to get up,” he said
angrily, “or I’ll give you a little more.”
</p>
<p>
Jimmy realized that for the time being escape was
impossible, and he sat back in his chair, determined
to make the best of a bad situation. He said nothing.
</p>
<p>
“What are you going to do with him, sir?” asked
the youth called Dick.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_130'></a>130</span>
</p>
<p>
“Keep him safe until after the race,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
“But you can’t keep him here all that time.”
</p>
<p>
“That’s so. I’ll have to find some place for him.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Dick, “I know where you can put
him.”
</p>
<p>
“Good; where is it?”
</p>
<p>
“I have an old uncle who lives down the creek.
He has a little house down there, and for a small
sum he’ll do almost anything.”
</p>
<p>
“And you think he’ll keep this kid quiet until after
the big race?”
</p>
<p>
“Sure.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you go and fix it up with him. Tell him
it will mean $50 to him.”
</p>
<p>
Dick left the room, and Jones turned to Jimmy.
</p>
<p>
“You see now what a fool you are,” he exclaimed.
“You might just as well have the money if you
had brains. Now you won’t get a cent.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t want it,” replied Jimmy quietly, “and if
you think you can hold me a prisoner till after the
race you are mistaken.”
</p>
<p>
“Is that so?” sneered Jones. “And how do you
figure you are going to get away?”
</p>
<p>
“That is my business,” said Jimmy.
</p>
<p>
Jones laughed aloud. He got up from his chair
and went toward the door.
</p>
<p>
“I’m going out for a few minutes,” he said, “and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_131'></a>131</span>
I am going to lock you in. You can yell all you
please. No one will pay any attention to you.”
</p>
<p>
He went through the door, and Jimmy heard the
key turn in the lock on the outside. No sooner had
the man gone than Jimmy walked quickly toward
a little window in the back of the room and looked
out. Then he shook his head gloomily.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly he was struck with an idea. He drew
a piece of paper and a pencil from his pocket, and
seating himself at the table wrote rapidly. Then
again he approached the window.
</p>
<p>
A few minutes later a small boy passed along
the street below. Jimmy whistled sharply, and the
boy looked up. Jimmy gesticulated violently, and
the lad below stopped.
</p>
<p>
Quickly Jimmy drew out his pocket knife, and a
silver quarter—all the money he had—and these he
wrapped in the paper upon which he had written,
and dropped them through the window.
</p>
<p>
They fell almost at the boy’s feet. The latter
stooped and picked them up. He glanced at the
address Jimmy had written, then looked up and
nodded. He pocketed the knife and the quarter
and then hurried away.
</p>
<p>
Jimmy breathed a sigh of relief, and sank into a
chair. He was still there when Jones returned.
</p>
<p>
“Decided to make the best of your lot, eh?” said
Jones, noticing that, apparently, the lad had given
up.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_132'></a>132</span>
</p>
<p>
“I guess I’ll have to,” was Jimmy’s reply.
</p>
<p>
“I’m glad you are that sensible. I don’t want
to use force unless it is necessary.”
</p>
<p>
Now Jimmy bethought himself it would be a good
plan to temporize with his captor.
</p>
<p>
“Look here, Jones,” he said, not deigning to use
the prefix, “Mr.,” “I have been thinking. Why
can’t we get together on this thing?”
</p>
<p>
Jones laughed amusedly.
</p>
<p>
“So you are going to try that on me,” he said.
“It’s too late now, son, and I am too old a bird
to be caught like that. Think you can fool me, eh,
and then go back and tell Willing all about it. No.
You had your chance and you refused; and to tell
the truth, I am glad of it. I will be money ahead.”
</p>
<p>
Half an hour later Dick returned.
</p>
<p>
“What luck?” asked Jones.
</p>
<p>
“The best,” was Dick’s reply. “My uncle said he
would be glad to keep him. And he’ll guard him
carefully, never fear.”
</p>
<p>
“That is settled then. Now how about getting
him there?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I would say that the thing to do is to get
a closed carriage. It’s still light, you know, and if
he made a break we might have trouble, for some
one would be sure to see us.”
</p>
<p>
“A good plan. Better go now and get a carriage.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_133'></a>133</span>
</p>
<p>
Dick again turned toward the door. Jones called
after him.
</p>
<p>
“And do the driving yourself.”
</p>
<p>
Fifteen minutes later Dick returned and announced
that the carriage was at the door. Jones
turned to Jimmy.
</p>
<p>
“Now,” he said harshly, “I want you to understand
that I will stand no nonsense. Make a false
move when you go out the door, or utter a sound,
and I’ll hit you over the head with this,” and he
displayed an evil-looking cane.
</p>
<p>
Jimmy made no reply, and went through the door
between Jones and his companion.
</p>
<p>
At first Jimmy had thought of flight, but the
nearness of his captors made this impossible. He
took his seat without a word, and soon was being
driven away.
</p>
<p>
Before a small frame house, at the far end of
town, upon the very brink of the creek, Dick pulled
up, and Jones and Jimmy alighted. As they approached
the house, an old man came to meet them.
</p>
<p>
“And is this the boy I am to guard?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“It is,” replied Jones.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I’ll guard him,” was the reply, and the old
man bared his ugly teeth in a snarl.
</p>
<p>
He took Jimmy by the coat collar, and twisted it
until the boy gasped.
</p>
<p>
“Get in the house there, you!” he commanded.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_134'></a>134</span>
</p>
<p>
Jimmy obeyed. Jones climbed back into the carriage
and was soon being driven away. The old
man followed Jimmy closely, snarling at every step.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_135'></a>135</span><a name='chXVII' id='chXVII'></a>CHAPTER XVII.—THE LONG SEARCH.</h2>
<p>
“I wonder what is detaining Jimmy?”
</p>
<p>
It was Mr. Willing who spoke. Mr. Willing,
Mr. Ashton, young Wolfe, Shirley and Mabel were
still seated at the supper table.
</p>
<p>
“I can’t understand why he wasn’t back hours
ago,” declared Mr. Willing. “That’s the trouble
with boys, you can’t depend on them. He has probably
stopped to play somewhere.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe Jimmy would do that,” said
Shirley. “Besides, he knows that he will have to
guard Gabriel to-night.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps,” said Mr. Ashton, “that is the reason
he is in no hurry to return. The chances are he has
had enough of that job, after his experience last
night.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe Jimmy is that kind of a boy, father,”
said Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Nor I,” spoke up young Wolfe. “He strikes
me as a brave and true lad. Perhaps something
has happened to him.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_136'></a>136</span>
</p>
<p>
“And what could have happened to him?” demanded
Mr. Willing. “He knows the way home,
and if he couldn’t get here, certainly he should have
sense enough to telephone.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know what to think,” said Shirley.
</p>
<p>
It was Mabel who finally guessed the answer to
the mystery.
</p>
<p>
“Maybe Mr. Jones has waylaid him,” she suggested.
</p>
<p>
Shirley sprang to her feet.
</p>
<p>
“My gracious!” she exclaimed. “Why didn’t we
think of that before? Of course, that is what’s the
matter. What shall we do?”
</p>
<p>
“Be quiet, Shirley,” said her father. “In the
first place, we do not know that that is the reason.
And in the second place, even if we did there is
nothing we could do to-night. And perhaps Mabel’s
theory is all wrong. Jimmy is likely to come strolling
in any time.”
</p>
<p>
“I believe Mabel is right,” said Leonard. “From
what I have heard this man Jones would stop at
nothing. As Jimmy is not here, I’ll volunteer to
sleep in the stable to-night.”
</p>
<p>
“But I cannot permit that,” said Mr. Willing.
“You are my guest. I——”
</p>
<p>
“Nevertheless,” Leonard interrupted, “I am going
to sleep there. The chances are that the conspirators
will not be active again to-night, but it is
always best to be prepared.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_137'></a>137</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Mr. Willing, “I won’t say no if you
insist. I’m sure that I shall rest easier, for if anything
should happen that Gabriel could not run in
the Derby——”
</p>
<p>
He broke off. “Thank you,” he added.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Mr. Ashton, later in the evening,
as they still waited for some word from Jimmy,
“there is no use sitting up all night. We might
as well turn in, so we can get busy early in the
morning.”
</p>
<p>
This suggestion was acted upon at once. Young
Wolfe, with a lantern, made his way to the stable,
where he took up his vigil just outside Gabriel’s
stall, for the animal would not allow him to enter.
The others went to bed.
</p>
<p>
The night passed peacefully, and all were up
bright and early in the morning.
</p>
<p>
“I am going to town immediately and see if I
can learn anything,” said Shirley at the breakfast
table.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll stay right here,” said Mr. Willing decidedly.
“I’ll do the looking myself.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll go too,” said Leonard.
</p>
<p>
“Then why can’t we go?” asked Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Mr. Willing, “I have no objection
to your going with Leonard, because he can keep
you out of mischief. I am going to start immediately.
You can follow as soon you are ready.
I’ll meet you at Wilson’s drug store at noon.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_138'></a>138</span>
</p>
<p>
He arose and ordered his horse saddled at once,
and before half an hour had passed he was well
started on his journey.
</p>
<p>
It was fully an hour later before the others were
ready to start in the large touring car, and by that
time Mr. Willing was already in town.
</p>
<p>
Just as the girls were stepping into the car the
distant yard gate opened, and the figure of a little
boy came into sight.
</p>
<p>
Mabel was the first to catch sight of him.
</p>
<p>
“Who is that?” she asked. “At first I thought
it was Jimmy.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll wait and see what he wants,” Shirley decided.
</p>
<p>
The youngster came up to them a few moments
later.
</p>
<p>
“What is it, little boy?” asked Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“I got a note for Mr. Willing,” came the reply.
</p>
<p>
“Who from?”
</p>
<p>
“I dunno. A fellow threw it out the winder to
me.”
</p>
<p>
“A message from Jimmy,” exclaimed Shirley, as
she jumped from the car. “Give it to me,” she
commanded.
</p>
<p>
But the boy held back.
</p>
<p>
“It’s for Mr. Willing,” he protested.
</p>
<p>
“I am Mr. Willing’s daughter,” said Shirley.
“Come, give me the note.”
</p>
<p>
She took it from his hand, and opened it eagerly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_139'></a>139</span>
</p>
<p>
“Who’s it from, Shirley?” asked Mabel. “Is it
from Jimmy?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” replied Shirley quietly. “Listen.” She
read:
</p>
<p>
“Held prisoner by Jones. Am going to be taken
to some house on creek and guarded till after race.
Don’t know where.
</p>
<p>
“<span class='sc'>JIMMY</span>.”
</p>
<p>
“I knew it,” said Mabel. “I was sure Jimmy
was in trouble of some kind.”
</p>
<p>
“But how are we to find the house?” asked Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” replied Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll have to tackle them all, that’s all there is
about that,” said Leonard decidedly. “And the
sooner we start the better, if you ask me.”
</p>
<p>
“Let’s hurry, then,” said Shirley anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“Wait a moment,” said Mabel. “Are you going
to let the little boy walk back to town?”
</p>
<p>
“Of course not,” replied Shirley. “But I was
so excited I forgot all about him. Jump in, little
boy.”
</p>
<p>
The boy needed no second bidding, and soon the
machine was speeding toward the pike.
</p>
<p>
“Can you take us to the place where the note was
dropped?” asked Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Yes’m,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
True to his word, the little fellow directed the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_140'></a>140</span>
car to the exact spot where he had picked up the
note.
</p>
<p>
“You wait here,” said young Wolfe, alighting,
“and I’ll run up and interview this fellow Jones, if
he’s in.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll go too,” said Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“So will I,” declared Mabel.
</p>
<p>
Young Wolfe hesitated.
</p>
<p>
“You know what your father said.”
</p>
<p>
“Never mind,” said Shirley. “Surely there is
no danger.”
</p>
<p>
The two girls followed Leonard into the place.
Leonard knocked on several doors before he received
an answer, but an old woman finally directed
him to the room occupied by Jones and Dick.
</p>
<p>
Leonard rapped loudly on the door. A moment
later the door swung inward, and Jones poked his
head out.
</p>
<p>
“What do you want?” he demanded.
</p>
<p>
“I want to see you,” said Leonard briefly, and
put his weight against the door, as Jones tried to
close it.
</p>
<p>
“You can’t come in here,” Jones protested.
</p>
<p>
“But I’m already in, my friend,” said Leonard.
</p>
<p>
“Who are you?” asked Jones.
</p>
<p>
“Why,” said Leonard, “my name is Wolfe, and
I am a friend of these young ladies here,” he added,
as the two girls appeared through the door.
</p>
<p>
Jones took a step back, surprise in his face.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_141'></a>141</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well, what do you want?” he demanded.
</p>
<p>
“We want to know what you have done with
Jimmy,” declared Shirley, approaching closer and
clenching her little fists.
</p>
<p>
“Jimmy?” repeated Jones, trying to look unconcerned.
“And who is Jimmy, pray?”
</p>
<p>
“You know who Jimmy is,” flared Mabel. “Tell
us where he is.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, you mean Mr. Willing’s stable boy?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“How should I know?” asked Jones, throwing
wide his arms in a gesture of ignorance.
</p>
<p>
Young Wolfe stepped close to Jones.
</p>
<p>
“There is no use pretending ignorance,” he said
quietly. “Show him the note, Shirley.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley drew the note from her handbag and
passed it to Jones, who read it carefully. Then the
latter looked up and smiled.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t blame you for suspecting me, in view
of this note,” he said with a smile, “but just the
same I shall have to deny the implication. The boy
is fooling you. I know nothing of his whereabouts.”
</p>
<p>
“That,” said Leonard calmly, “is a lie.”
</p>
<p>
Jones took a threatening step forward, but Leonard
did not give an inch.
</p>
<p>
“A liar, am I?” said Jones. “I’ll show you.”
</p>
<p>
His arm came up from his side, and he aimed a
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_142'></a>142</span>
terrific blow at Leonard’s head. But quick as he
was Leonard was quicker.
</p>
<p>
With a movement he avoided the blow, and stepping
forward seized Jones’ arm before the latter
could recover himself. He twisted it quickly and
sharply, and Jones stepped back with a cry of pain.
</p>
<p>
“None of that,” said Leonard sternly. “Now,
will you tell us where Jimmy is or not?”
</p>
<p>
“I have told you I don’t know,” said Jones.
</p>
<p>
With a sudden wrench he freed his arm and
darted through the door before Leonard could make
a move to stop him.
</p>
<p>
“After him quick,” said Shirley. “He’ll get
away.”
</p>
<p>
Leonard and the two girls darted through the
door and down the steps after the fleeing man, but
when they reached the sidewalk Jones had disappeared.
</p>
<p>
“We’ve lost him,” she cried.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Mabel, “and he’ll hurry to the place
where Jimmy is being held, and take him some
place else. It was a mistake to show him that note,
for he is aware we know that Jimmy is confined
some place on the creek.”
</p>
<p>
“Then the best thing to do,” said Leonard, “is
to get down by the creek. We may be fortunate
enough to hit the right direction.”
</p>
<p>
“Let’s go at once then,” said Shirley.
</p>
<p>
Quickly the three clambered into the car, and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_143'></a>143</span>
Shirley, who was driving, started it off with a
lurch.
</p>
<p>
“Let’s hope we shall not be too late,” she cried
over her shoulder, as the car, setting speed regulations
at naught, gathered headway.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_144'></a>144</span><a name='chXVIII' id='chXVIII'></a>CHAPTER XVIII.—ON THE TRAIL.</h2>
<p>
The little town of Paris stretches out for a considerable
distance along Stoner Creek, and for this
reason Shirley realized that the chances of picking
the locality where Jimmy was held prisoner were
slim. Nevertheless, there was always the chance
that they might be fortunate enough to find the
place.
</p>
<p>
The car rushed down Main Street, and turned to
the right just off the bridge. It was Shirley’s plan
to get to the extreme edge of the town and then
come back along the creek slowly. They had made
good time, and it was hardly probable that Jones
could have reached the creek before them.
</p>
<p>
They reached the northern extremity of the town
without a sight of Jones, and then turning the car
about, Shirley drove south slowly. Several times
the girl stopped to ask questions of pedestrians,
but the result was always the same. No one seemed
to know Jones, and none knew of any house containing
a prisoner.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_145'></a>145</span>
</p>
<p>
Finally Leonard called upon Shirley to stop.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll get out and do a little inquiring at some of
the houses along here,” he said.
</p>
<p>
He alighted. At the first house he approached he
gained no information, nor at the second nor at the
third. At the fourth, however, he came upon a
clue.
</p>
<p>
“Somebody told me,” said the woman who answered
his knock, “that a closed carriage drove
up to old Briggs’ house yesterday and that three
men were in it. One went into the house with
Briggs, and the others drove away.”
</p>
<p>
“Did you hear what he looked like?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, he was young. That’s all I know.”
</p>
<p>
“And where does this man Briggs live?”
</p>
<p>
“About eight blocks south, in a little shanty. I
know his nephew from Cincinnati has been staying
with him. Anybody down there can tell you where
Briggs lives.”
</p>
<p>
Leonard thanked the woman and returned to the
waiting automobile. He told the girls what he had
learned, and Shirley drove the car in the direction
of Briggs’ home.
</p>
<p>
“Better stop a block away,” said Leonard.
</p>
<p>
Shirley did so, and again Leonard climbed out.
Through inquiry he learned which was Briggs’ house
and hastened to it. An old man answered his
knock.
</p>
<p>
“Are you Mr. Briggs?” asked Leonard.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_146'></a>146</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” was the reply. “What do you want?”
</p>
<p>
There was something in the man’s manner that
convinced Leonard he was on the right track. He
determined to try a bold shot.
</p>
<p>
“I want to see your prisoner,” he said sternly.
</p>
<p>
“Prisoner,” echoed the old man, taking a step
backward. “What prisoner?”
</p>
<p>
“The boy you are holding for Jones.”
</p>
<p>
The old man recovered himself.
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t any prisoner,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, yes you have,” said Leonard, “and I want
him right now. Understand?”
</p>
<p>
The old man looked at him with an evil leer.
</p>
<p>
“Get out of here,” he shouted, and gave Leonard
an unexpected push.
</p>
<p>
Leonard, taken unaware, stumbled back, and at
the same moment the old man stepped inside the
house, and closed and locked the door.
</p>
<p>
Leonard sprang forward again and laid hold of
the knob. Then he put his weight against the door,
but it would not budge. He walked back to where
the girls waited for him.
</p>
<p>
“He’s in there, all right,” he said grimly. “But I
can’t get in.”
</p>
<p>
“Can’t you break down the door?” asked Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“I might,” said Leonard, “but if I did I probably
would be shot for my pains. You can’t force your
way into a man’s house, you know.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_147'></a>147</span>
</p>
<p>
“Then what are we to do?” exclaimed Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Call the police,” said Leonard grimly. “They’ll
go in, all right, whether they have a right to do so
or not.”
</p>
<p>
“Let’s hurry then,” said Shirley anxiously.
“There is no telling what may happen to Jimmy
unless we make haste.”
</p>
<p>
Leonard climbed back into the machine.
</p>
<p>
“To the police station at once,” he said.
</p>
<p>
Just as the machine started off, Shirley’s attention
was attracted by a man who darted suddenly
across the street and into the rear of the house
Leonard had just left.
</p>
<p>
“Jones!” she exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
Leonard and Mabel also had seen the hurrying
figure.
</p>
<p>
“That’s who it is, all right,” said Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“There is no doubt about it,” declared Leonard.
“We’ll round them all up together.”
</p>
<p>
At the police station Leonard explained the situation
in a few words. Two men were detailed
to go with them and investigate. All climbed into
the machine, and in a few moments were back before
Briggs’ home.
</p>
<p>
Leonard and the two girls approached the door
with the two policemen. One of the officers rapped
loudly upon the door with his club. There was no
answer, and the policeman rapped again. Still
there was no answer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_148'></a>148</span>
</p>
<p>
“Open up, Briggs, or we shall break the door
down,” called one of the officers.
</p>
<p>
Again no answer.
</p>
<p>
“Kick her in, Bill,” said the first officer.
</p>
<p>
He suited the action to the word, and there was
a resounding crash as his boot struck the door a
hard blow. The second officer also delivered several
heavy kicks.
</p>
<p>
There was the sound of splintering wood, and in
a few moments the door gave way, shattered. The
officers rushed in with poised clubs, and Leonard
and the two girls followed them closely.
</p>
<p>
Straight through the house they went, but their
quest was vain. There was no one there.
</p>
<p>
Leonard, glancing up, spied what appeared to be
an attic.
</p>
<p>
“Give me a hand up,” he called to one of the two
policemen.
</p>
<p>
The latter obeyed and Leonard scrambled up
above.
</p>
<p>
“Be careful,” whispered Shirley.
</p>
<p>
Leonard struck a match and looked around.
There was no one there.
</p>
<p>
“Nobody home,” he said, after he had dropped
down again.
</p>
<p>
“Where did they go?” demanded Shirley anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“My gracious!” exclaimed Mabel. “Why didn’t
we think of it before?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_149'></a>149</span>
</p>
<p>
“Think of what?” asked Shirley quickly.
</p>
<p>
“Why, the creek. They have probably escaped
in a launch.”
</p>
<p>
Without pausing to reply, Shirley turned and
darted from the house toward the creek, the others
following closely. Several rowboats lay idly by,
and in one of them, fishing, were two men.
</p>
<p>
“Did you see anything of Briggs?” demanded
Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Miss,” said one of the men. “He, and
three others, just left in a launch. Is anything the
matter?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said one of the officers. “They are a
bunch of crooks, and have kidnapped a boy.”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t say,” exclaimed one of the fishermen.
“Do you want to catch ’em?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Shirley eagerly, “but how can we?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, I have a launch about a hundred yards
from here,” said the man. “She is all ready to
move, and can outrun anything on the creek.”
</p>
<p>
As he spoke, he came ashore and started along
the bank at a run. Shirley, Mabel, Leonard and
the two officers followed close at his heels.
</p>
<p>
Another moment, and they came upon a large,
powerful launch moored to a landing.
</p>
<p>
“Climb in,” said the man.
</p>
<p>
The others needed no second invitation. Shirley,
with the two officers, took their places in the bow
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_150'></a>150</span>
of the little craft, while Mabel and Leonard were
forced to remain further aft.
</p>
<p>
The fisherman pushed the launch off, and
scrambled aboard. Then he turned quickly to the
engine, and a faint sputtering a few moments later
gave evidence that the launch was ready for the
chase.
</p>
<p>
Gradually the little craft gathered headway, until
she seemed to be flying through the water. Through
scores of rowboats and other small boats, she
wormed her way at terrific speed, and at last, far
ahead, the pursuers could make out the form of a
second launch, also chugging along at full speed.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll get ’em,” said the fisherman confidently.
“The <em>Sybil</em> can outrun anything on the creek.”
</p>
<p>
“The <em>Sybil</em>, a pretty name for a launch,” Shirley
thought, excited as she was.
</p>
<p>
She kept her eyes ahead, and soon it became evident
that the pursuers were gaining. They were
now far beyond the town, and one of the officers
spoke.
</p>
<p>
“To tell the truth, we really have no authority out
of the city, but we’ll take a hand just the same.
Might makes right, you know.”
</p>
<p>
“We are likely to need you,” said Leonard.
</p>
<p>
Now the <em>Sybil</em> had gained sufficiently for those
aboard to make out the faces of those in the pursued
craft. It was as they had expected. The occupants of
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_151'></a>151</span>
the first boat were Jones, Briggs, Jimmy
and another young man, whom none recognized.
</p>
<p>
“Guess that is Briggs’ nephew from Cincinnati,”
said Leonard, remembering the conversation he
had had with the woman who told him of Briggs’
prisoner.
</p>
<p>
Shirley glanced at the young man in the other
boat curiously.
</p>
<p>
“I seem to have seen him some place before,” she
said. “I can’t place him, though.”
</p>
<p>
Suddenly Jones was seen to rise up in the other
boat, and Leonard, divining his intention, cried
out in a loud voice:
</p>
<p>
“Look out! Duck!”
</p>
<p>
In spite of their surprise, all obeyed.
</p>
<p>
From the first boat there came a puff of smoke,
followed by a sharp crack. Something whined over
the <em>Sybil</em>.
</p>
<p>
“They are shooting at us,” said Leonard calmly.
“You girls keep down in the boat.”
</p>
<p>
“Two can play at that game,” said one of the
officers.
</p>
<p>
He drew his own revolver, and brought it to
bear. But before he could fire, Shirley sprang to
her feet and seized his arm.
</p>
<p>
“Careful,” she said, “you are likely to hit
Jimmy.”
</p>
<p>
The officer lowered his weapon.
</p>
<p>
At the same moment Jones fired again.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_152'></a>152</span>
</p>
<p>
Leonard clapped his right hand to his left shoulder.
</p>
<p>
Shirley noticed this move.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter?” she asked anxiously. “Are
you hit?”
</p>
<p>
“Just a scratch, I guess,” replied Leonard quietly.
“We’ll make them pay for that.”
</p>
<p>
“We will,” agreed Shirley through clenched
teeth.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_153'></a>153</span><a name='chXIX' id='chXIX'></a>CHAPTER XIX.—DEFEAT.</h2>
<p>
“Look out! He’s going to shoot again,” cried
one of the officers. “Down, quick!”
</p>
<p>
Jones was standing aft in the launch and had
levelled his revolver in deliberate aim. But before
he could pull the trigger, there was an unexpected
move in the boat.
</p>
<p>
The third member of the party of conspirators—the
young man whose face was so strangely
familiar to Shirley—suddenly sprang to his feet,
and before Jones could realize his intention, had
wrested the revolver from his hand with a quick
move. Jones turned upon him angrily, and they
grappled.
</p>
<p>
For several moments they swayed unsteadily in
the boat, causing it to rock violently; and then
Jones, putting forth a strenuous effort, sent his
opponent hurling overboard and by another and
more strenuous effort, succeeded in regaining his
own balance just as it seemed that he, too, must
tumble into the water.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_154'></a>154</span>
</p>
<p>
“Slow down!” cried Shirley to the fisherman.
“We must pick him up.”
</p>
<p>
The owner of the boat complied, and steered the
craft to where the unfortunate youth’s head showed
above the water at that moment. Leonard stretched
forth his unwounded arm, and succeeded in dragging
the victim aboard, where he sank to the bottom
of the boat panting.
</p>
<p>
Shirley took one look at the bedraggled youth,
and then exclaimed aloud:
</p>
<p>
“Dick!”
</p>
<p>
Their erstwhile opponent looked at her in surprise.
It was plain that he did not recognize her.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you know me?” asked Shirley, half laughing.
</p>
<p>
“No,” returned the youth somewhat sullenly.
</p>
<p>
“Then I’ll refresh your memory,” said Shirley.
“Do you remember a street fight in Cincinnati one
night not long ago, when your own friends turned
on you because you befriended a strange youth, who
later turned out to be a girl?”
</p>
<p>
Dick’s face took on a reddish hue.
</p>
<p>
“And do you remember escorting the girl home?”
continued Shirley, “and disappearing before she had
an opportunity of thanking you? Do you remember
me now?”
</p>
<p>
Dick hung his head sheepishly.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I remember,” he said.
</p>
<p>
“And how is it,” demanded Shirley, “that I find
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_155'></a>155</span>
you mixed up in this affair? How do you happen
to be on such friendly terms with that scoundrel
Jones?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, it’s a long story,” returned Dick in some
confusion.
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t think it of you, Dick,” said Shirley.
“You proved such a valiant champion, that I believed
I should always find you fighting on the
side of the right.”
</p>
<p>
“And so you shall,” responded Dick, lifting his
head, “if you have further need of me. I didn’t
really know who Jones was when I got mixed up
with him. And had I known he was plotting
against you I would have had nothing to do with
the affair. I am ready to help you, if you can
make use of me.”
</p>
<p>
“I knew I couldn’t be wrong,” said the girl with
a bright smile, “and I am glad to have you on our
side. Perhaps you can tell me why Jones has
kidnapped Jimmy?”
</p>
<p>
“He is planning to keep him from riding in the
Derby. He says that without Jimmy, Gabriel cannot
possibly win.”
</p>
<p>
“I see,” said Shirley. “It’s just as I thought.
And where is he taking him now?”
</p>
<p>
“I do not know,” was the reply. “He has some
safe place in view, though.”
</p>
<p>
While the <em>Sybil</em> paused to pick up Dick, the other
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_156'></a>156</span>
launch forged ahead, and now had disappeared
from view around a bend in the creek.
</p>
<p>
Shirley turned to the owner of the boat.
</p>
<p>
“Can we catch them?” she asked anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“Just leave it to me,” returned the man grimly.
“If they stay in the water we’ll come up with them
before long.”
</p>
<p>
Rounding the bend they again came in sight of
the other launch, and as they did so Shirley uttered
a cry of dismay.
</p>
<p>
Close into the shore the pursued launch rode
gently upon the water. Her engines had been
stopped, and she had been deserted. There was
not a soul aboard.
</p>
<p>
“Where do you suppose they have gone?” demanded
Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“They have taken to the woods,” replied Shirley,
“and the chances are we have lost them altogether.”
</p>
<p>
Jenkins, for as such the owner of the <em>Sybil</em> introduced
himself, ran his launch close beside the other,
and all stepped quickly ashore. In the soft mud,
footsteps leading toward the woods nearby were
plainly visible, showing that the fugitives had gone
in that direction.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll follow them, if you give the word, Miss
Willing,” said Dick.
</p>
<p>
“And Mabel and I will go too,” said Shirley.
</p>
<p>
Dick looked at young Wolfe somewhat dubiously.
</p>
<p>
“It is hardly girls’ work,” he replied.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_157'></a>157</span>
</p>
<p>
“Right you are,” agreed Leonard. “You girls
stay here by the boat.”
</p>
<p>
“But we want to go,” Mabel pouted. “We are
more interested in this than any of you.”
</p>
<p>
“The young men are right,” said Jenkins firmly.
“Jones must be a desperate man. You girls are
safer here.”
</p>
<p>
“We do not wish to be obstinate,” said Shirley.
“We know that you are doing this for us, and if
you tell us to stay here, we shall do so, of course.”
</p>
<p>
Jenkins and the two young men breathed a sigh
of relief, as did the two policemen.
</p>
<p>
“You wait here until we return then,” said Leonard.
“Come on, men.”
</p>
<p>
The five disappeared in the woods, leaving the
two girls beside the boat alone.
</p>
<p>
“I hope they get them,” said Shirley grimly.
</p>
<p>
“So do I,” agreed Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“I am glad Dick is with us,” said Shirley slowly.
“Somehow I have a lot of confidence in him. You
know I have seen him in action and know what he
can do.”
</p>
<p>
“He is a likeable boy,” declared Mabel. “It’s too
bad he has mixed with such bad companions.”
</p>
<p>
“I am going to see if I can’t get father to help
him,” said Shirley. “Maybe he would be willing to
work on the farm.”
</p>
<p>
“From the way he looked at you,” said Mabel,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_158'></a>158</span>
“I should say that he would be glad to work any
place where you might be.”
</p>
<p>
“The idea, Mabel,” said Shirley, but nevertheless
her face grew red.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly both girls were startled by a stealthy
tread behind them. They wheeled about, and looked
into the sneering countenance of Jones.
</p>
<p>
And beside him was Briggs, and between the two,
his hands bound and a gag in his mouth, was
Jimmy.
</p>
<p>
“So,” said Jones, with an evil smile, “we have
captured two more of the enemy, eh?”
</p>
<p>
Neither girl replied.
</p>
<p>
Jones motioned toward the launch.
</p>
<p>
“Climb aboard, there, quick!” he commanded.
</p>
<p>
Both girls hesitated.
</p>
<p>
“You hear me?” demanded Jones, taking a step
forward. “I am not to be trifled with. Move
now!”
</p>
<p>
Shirley and Mabel thought better of their hesitancy,
and without a word climbed aboard the <em>Sybil</em>.
Jimmy was shoved aboard after them, and then came
Jones. Briggs stopped to shove the boat off and
then clambered aboard.
</p>
<p>
“Straight down the creek,” ordered Jones, as
Briggs stooped over the engine.
</p>
<p>
The launch moved off slowly.
</p>
<p>
“You see we gave your friends the slip,” smiled
Jones. “Now we’ll just leave them behind.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_159'></a>159</span>
</p>
<p>
“What are you going to do with us?” demanded
Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Never mind,” returned her captor. “You’ll find
out soon enough.”
</p>
<p>
At that moment there came a shout from the
shore, and turning, the girls saw their friends rushing
down toward the water. Jones muttered to
himself.
</p>
<p>
“Why couldn’t we have had a little better start?”
</p>
<p>
Shirley rose in her seat and waved to her friends.
</p>
<p>
“Sit down there,” said Jones harshly, half rising.
</p>
<p>
Shirley obeyed, for she knew that she had been
seen, and felt certain of speedy relief.
</p>
<p>
Ashore, the five were hurriedly piling into the
other boat, the one occupied by Jones when the
chase had started, and soon it was coming after
them. But the <em>Sybil</em> was much faster, as already
had been proven, and it seemed that there was little
likelihood of the pursuers catching up with them.
</p>
<p>
The <em>Sybil</em> gained rapidly and it was plain she
would soon run away from the pursuer.
</p>
<p>
Jones, sitting a few feet from Shirley, drew a
pipe from his pocket, and filled it calmly.
</p>
<p>
“I hope you young ladies do not object,” he said,
and struck a match.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly Shirley jumped to her feet and rushed
at Jones, thinking to catch him unprepared and
push him into the water. But Jones was too quick
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_160'></a>160</span>
for her. He stood up, stepped aside, and it seemed
a miracle that Shirley did not go overboard.
</p>
<p>
Jones smiled.
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t try it again if I were you,” he said
quietly. “I am not to be caught napping.”
</p>
<p>
He sat down again, and Shirley resumed her
seat.
</p>
<p>
Now the <em>Sybil</em> lost sight of her pursuer around
a bend in the stream. From this point on the
creek wound about more frequently, and it was
plain to Shirley that the pursuers were hopelessly
outdistanced.
</p>
<p>
Then Jones spoke to Briggs.
</p>
<p>
“Run ashore,” he commanded.
</p>
<p>
Briggs obeyed without a word, and a few moments
later, they all stepped out upon the bank.
</p>
<p>
“Come,” said Jones, “let’s get out of sight before
our friends arrive.”
</p>
<p>
He motioned the two girls to precede him along
what they found to be a narrow path.
</p>
<p>
“Briggs,” said Jones, “you go back and start the
launch down the creek by itself. Then they won’t
know where we are.”
</p>
<p>
Briggs hastened to obey, and a moment later the
<em>Sybil</em> was moving out of sight around another bend.
</p>
<p>
“They won’t find us now,” said Jones.
</p>
<p>
Taking advantage of a moment when Jones was
not looking, Mabel quietly hung her white handkerchief
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_161'></a>161</span>
upon a bush. It was in plain view of the
creek.
</p>
<p>
Shirley saw her friend’s action, but dared not
show she had, by even the slightest change of expression.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_162'></a>162</span><a name='chXX' id='chXX'></a>CHAPTER XX.—APPARENT VICTORY.</h2>
<p>
Meanwhile, where was the second launch and
crew? Even going at full speed, it was plainly
evident to all on board that there was little prospect
of overtaking the <em>Sybil</em>.
</p>
<p>
When the party had returned to the bank of the
stream after an unsuccessful search of the little
woods, it had not needed the wave of Shirley’s hand
from the <em>Sybil</em> to tell them what had happened.
It was Dick who spoke first.
</p>
<p>
“They have doubled back on their tracks and
captured the girls and the launch,” he exclaimed
when he noticed Shirley and Mabel were nowhere
to be seen.
</p>
<p>
The others cried out in alarm. In the distance
they could see the launch speeding down the stream.
It was at that moment Shirley rose and waved to
them. Leonard’s keen eyes caught the signal, and
he cried out:
</p>
<p>
“Into the other launch quick and after them!”
</p>
<p>
Hastily jumping aboard, the second launch was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_163'></a>163</span>
put into motion and they gave chase at full speed.
</p>
<p>
But the <em>Sybil</em> gained steadily.
</p>
<p>
“It’s no use,” said Jenkins. “We can’t catch
them. As I told you, the <em>Sybil</em> can outrun anything
in these parts.”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll keep after them anyhow,” said Dick.
“You never can tell what will happen. They may
meet with an accident.”
</p>
<p>
And so the five continued their apparently hopeless
pursuit. An hour later, Leonard, who stood in
the extreme bow of the launch, straining his eyes
ahead, exclaimed aloud. The others looked at him
eagerly, and he pointed straight ahead.
</p>
<p>
“There’s the <em>Sybil</em>,” he cried. “She’s run ashore.
They must have landed.”
</p>
<p>
A few minutes later the launch ran up alongside
the <em>Sybil</em> and all jumped out.
</p>
<p>
“If we only knew which way they went,” said
Leonard.
</p>
<p>
Dick had been looking at the ground carefully.
In the soft mud there was not a single footprint.
Dick looked at the engine of the <em>Sybil</em>. It was still
running.
</p>
<p>
“They didn’t land here,” he said quietly.
</p>
<p>
“What?” exclaimed Leonard.
</p>
<p>
“I say, they didn’t land here.”
</p>
<p>
“How do you make that out?”
</p>
<p>
“Well, if they had landed here there would certainly
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_164'></a>164</span>
be footprints. They couldn’t have walked
through this soft mud without leaving tracks.”
</p>
<p>
“The lad is right,” murmured Jenkins.
</p>
<p>
“Then how do you account for the launch being
here?” asked one of the policemen.
</p>
<p>
“Easily,” said Dick. “They started the engine
and let her go. See, the engine is still running,
and if she had not been caught in this bunch of
weeds she would still be going down stream.”
</p>
<p>
“You are right,” Leonard agreed. “And there
is no telling how far back they deserted her. What
shall we do?”
</p>
<p>
“First,” said Jenkins, “we’ll reoccupy the <em>Sybil</em>
and leave the other launch here.”
</p>
<p>
“After which,” said Dick, “we’ll turn back, and
go slowly, keeping as close to shore as possible.
We may be able to find where they landed.”
</p>
<p>
This plan was adopted. Jenkins turned the
<em>Sybil’s</em> head upstream once more, and they started
off slowly, keeping close in-shore.
</p>
<p>
For half an hour they moved along, and then
Dick’s keen eyes caught sight of a piece of white
fluttering from a bush fifty feet ahead. He looked
at it steadily for a few moments, and then gave a
start.
</p>
<p>
“Run in here,” he commanded Jenkins.
</p>
<p>
The latter did as he was told. Dick leaped
lightly ashore and approached the fluttering piece
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_165'></a>165</span>
of white, which he now saw was a handkerchief.
He picked it up and returned to the boat.
</p>
<p>
“Do you recognize this?” he asked, passing it
to Leonard.
</p>
<p>
Leonard glanced at it carefully. In one corner
were two small initials.
</p>
<p>
“M.A.,” he read. “Mabel Ashton,” he exclaimed.
“How do you suppose that got there?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s plain enough,” said Dick simply. “She
dropped it there in the hopes that we might find it,
and so learn where they had landed.”
</p>
<p>
“Then,” said Leonard, “there should be footprints.”
</p>
<p>
“Not here,” said Dick. “You will notice that the
ground is very rocky. Evidently that is the reason
Jones selected this spot to land.”
</p>
<p>
“By Jove!” said Leonard.
</p>
<p>
Dick spoke again. “They must have gone this
way. We might as well get out and look around a
bit.”
</p>
<p>
Accordingly all stepped ashore.
</p>
<p>
“Now,” said Dick, “I would suggest that we all
spread out, keeping about a hundred yards apart,
and go straight ahead.”
</p>
<p>
Leonard, who had been scrutinizing the ground
carefully, uttered an exclamation. The others hurried
to him.
</p>
<p>
“A path!” exclaimed Leonard. “They probably
went this way.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_166'></a>166</span>
</p>
<p>
“We’ll see where the path leads at any rate,”
said Dick. “Nevertheless I suggest that we spread
out just the same. They may not have stuck to
the path.”
</p>
<p>
This plan was acted upon, and the five spread
on either side of the path. Leonard took the path,
while on his right were the two officers, each a
hundred yards apart, and on his left Jenkins and
Dick, also the same distance apart.
</p>
<p>
They started forward.
</p>
<p>
For half an hour they walked on, and gradually
the woods became more dense, making progress difficult.
Suddenly it began to grow dark.
</p>
<p>
Leonard glanced at his watch.
</p>
<p>
“Great Scott!” he exclaimed. “It’s after six.
I had no idea it was so late.”
</p>
<p>
He gave a shrill whistle, a prearranged signal,
and the others came toward him.
</p>
<p>
“We must try and do something before dark,”
he explained. “We don’t want to stay here all
night, and we can’t give up the chase until we
have found the girls.”
</p>
<p>
“We shall have to go more swiftly, then,” said
Dick. “Back to your places, men.”
</p>
<p>
All spread out again, and the advance continued.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly Leonard spied something white in the
path ahead of him. He stooped and picked it up.
It was a second handkerchief. Leonard looked for
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_167'></a>167</span>
some mark of identification. In a corner he found
the initials “S.W.”
</p>
<p>
“We are on the right track,” he muttered to himself.
</p>
<p>
And then he stopped still.
</p>
<p>
Two shrill whistles split the air.
</p>
<p>
A moment more and the others gathered around
him.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter?” they asked.
</p>
<p>
Dick, the last to appear, came up at that moment.
</p>
<p>
“I’ve found them,” he whispered.
</p>
<p>
“Where?” demanded the others.
</p>
<p>
“There is a little shack a short distance ahead,”
Dick explained. “I could see smoke coming from
the chimney. I feel sure that Jones, thinking he
has given us the slip, has ordered a halt.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Leonard, “what are we going to do
about it? We can’t stand here all night.”
</p>
<p>
“The thing to do,” said Jenkins, “is to surround
the place, and then close in on them. There are
only two of them.”
</p>
<p>
“You’ll find there will only be one when it comes
to a fight,” said Dick grimly. “My uncle Briggs
won’t take a hand.”
</p>
<p>
“So much the better,” said Leonard. “Then we
have only Jones to contend with.”
</p>
<p>
“Right,” said Dick, “and Jones is for me to
handle.”
</p>
<p>
Leonard looked at him peculiarly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_168'></a>168</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh, all right,” he said. “If that’s the way you
feel about it I won’t interfere unless you have
need of me.”
</p>
<p>
“I won’t have any need of you,” was the reply.
“But come, let’s get busy.”
</p>
<p>
It was quite dark now, but the stars already
twinkled and there was promise of bright moonlight.
The five made their way forward stealthily.
</p>
<p>
Ten minutes later they came within sight of the
shanty, and they stopped for a moment. Suddenly
Dick pointed straight ahead.
</p>
<p>
“Look,” he whispered.
</p>
<p>
The others gazed in the direction he pointed.
There, lying upon the ground, they recognized the
figures of Jones, Briggs and Jimmy.
</p>
<p>
“Guess they have let the girls sleep in the house,”
said Leonard. “Now is a good time to advance.
The men are asleep.”
</p>
<p>
Cautiously they advanced again, and then, when
they were perhaps twenty yards from the sleepers,
Jones suddenly sat up and looked around.
</p>
<p>
His eyes fell upon the cautiously-approaching figures,
and he jumped to his feet with an exclamation
of dismay, and turned to run. But Dick was
too quick for him.
</p>
<p>
Dashing forward at top speed, he hurled himself
forward and caught Jones by the legs. Jones came
to the ground with a crash.
</p>
<p>
He was up in a moment, however, and grappling
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_169'></a>169</span>
with his assailant. But this time Dick was prepared
for him, and with solid ground under his
feet, he was more than a match for the older man.
</p>
<p>
Backward and forward, backward and forward
they swayed, each trying to gain a hold by which
he might throw the other. And Dick got his first.
</p>
<p>
Exerting his utmost strength, he heaved as hard
as he could, and Jones, large though he was, went
crashing to the ground, where he lay still.
</p>
<p>
In falling his head had come in contact with a
sharp stone, and he was temporarily stunned.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, the others had subdued Briggs,
and then had stopped to watch the struggle between
Jones and Dick. That over, Leonard stooped and
unbound and ungagged Jimmy, and then turned
toward the shanty.
</p>
<p>
“Might as well let the girls out,” he said.
</p>
<p>
He knocked upon the door. There was no response
and he knocked again. Still no response.
</p>
<p>
Leonard burst the door in with a single kick of
his foot and stepped over the threshold. Then he
started back in amazement and uttered a low cry.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter?” demanded Dick, approaching
and peering over his shoulder.
</p>
<p>
“Matter!” repeated Leonard. “Matter enough!
The girls are not here!”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_170'></a>170</span><a name='chXXI' id='chXXI'></a>CHAPTER XXI.—AN UNPLEASANT SITUATION.</h2>
<p>
Dick pushed by Leonard and entered the shanty.
It was true. There was no sign of either Shirley
or Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“What on earth can have happened to them?”
asked Leonard anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t the slightest idea,” returned Dick.
“We’ll ask Jones.”
</p>
<p>
They stepped outside again.
</p>
<p>
Upon Leonard’s first cry of surprise, Jenkins and
the two policemen had moved toward the house,
and for the moment Jones had been left unguarded.
The prisoner was not slow to take advantage of
his opportunity and no sooner had his captors’
backs been turned than he took to his heels and
soon disappeared in the darkness.
</p>
<p>
Consequently, when Leonard and Dick came from
the shanty there was no Jones to be found.
</p>
<p>
Dick turned upon Jenkins and the officers angrily.
</p>
<p>
“You are a fine bunch, you are,” he said with
withering scorn. “A nice lot of guards I must say.
Jones has gone.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_171'></a>171</span>
</p>
<p>
The three looked from one to the other sheepishly,
and Jenkins opened his mouth to speak.
</p>
<p>
“Never mind,” said Dick. “There is no use talking
about it now. The first thing is to find the
girls.”
</p>
<p>
“And where are we to look for them?” demanded
Leonard.
</p>
<p>
Dick shrugged his shoulders.
</p>
<p>
“You know as much about it as I do,” he replied.
</p>
<p>
“Then,” said Leonard, “I suggest that we go first
to the launch, to make sure that it is all right.
Jones is likely to steal it again.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess you are right,” said Dick. “Come on.”
</p>
<p>
He stooped for a moment to lift up Jimmy Smith,
who still sat on the ground. The latter arose slowly
and stretched his cramped limbs.
</p>
<p>
“My, but it feels good to be loose again,” he
said.
</p>
<p>
He followed the others toward the creek.
</p>
<p>
The party made rapid progress for they did not
wish Jones to get there ahead of them. But their
fear was unnecessary, for Jones, once out of sight,
had sat down, feeling safe in the darkness.
</p>
<p>
A short time after, the party of searchers arrived
at the bank of the little stream.
</p>
<p>
“Great Scott! where’s the launch?” exclaimed
Leonard.
</p>
<p>
The others also uttered exclamations of astonishment.
There was no sign of the <em>Sybil</em>.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_172'></a>172</span>
</p>
<p>
“Jones must have arrived ahead of us,” said
Jenkins.
</p>
<p>
Dick was struck with a sudden idea. He uttered
a low chuckle. The others turned upon him, and
one of the officers said:
</p>
<p>
“This is no laughing matter. What’s so funny,
anyhow?”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Dick, “I believe I have solved the
disappearance of the <em>Sybil</em>. I am sure that it was
not Jones who took it, and Uncle Briggs is still
where we left him, so it could not have been him.”
</p>
<p>
“Then who was it?” demanded Leonard.
</p>
<p>
“The two young ladies,” replied Dick.
</p>
<p>
The others gazed at him in surprise.
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?” asked Jenkins.
</p>
<p>
“Just what I say. In some manner they succeeded
in escaping from the shanty before we arrived.
Then they must have made their way back
here, and finding the launch, appropriated it for
their own use. You must remember that Jones,
not we, came here in the <em>Sybil</em>. The last the girls
saw of us we were in the other launch. It was impossible
for them to tell we had recaptured the
<em>Sybil</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“I believe you are right,” said Leonard.
</p>
<p>
“I’m sure of it,” replied Dick.
</p>
<p>
“Then what are we to do? We are marooned
here for the rest of the night.”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Dick, “we might walk down stream.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_173'></a>173</span>
It’s possible we may be able to find the other launch,
which we abandoned.”
</p>
<p>
“There is no use staying here, that’s certain,”
agreed Leonard. “But the chances are we won’t
find it.”
</p>
<p>
“There is nothing like trying,” said Dick briefly.
“Come on.”
</p>
<p>
He led the way and the others followed.
</p>
<p>
Dick’s solution of the disappearance had been
correct. Left alone in the little shanty early in
the evening, the two girls had succeeded in forcing
the door. Peering out and seeing Jones and Briggs
fast asleep, they had decided to make a break for
liberty.
</p>
<p>
Accordingly they slipped quietly from their
prison and were soon lost in the darkness. They
made their way to the bank of the creek with little
difficulty, and there came upon the <em>Sybil</em>, tied up
to a tree.
</p>
<p>
“We are in luck,” said Mabel. “But how does
it come that the launch is here. This looks like
the place we landed, and I saw Briggs start the
boat down stream.”
</p>
<p>
“Then it can’t be the place we landed,” returned
Shirley. “We must be further down stream than
we thought.”
</p>
<p>
“But some one has tied the boat up,” protested
Shirley. “Who do you suppose it was?”
</p>
<p>
“I haven’t any idea; and I don’t see that it makes
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_174'></a>174</span>
any difference. We’ll get aboard and start upstream
immediately. Our absence is likely to be discovered,
and unless we hurry, we may be recaptured.”
</p>
<p>
“Let’s hurry then,” said Mabel.
</p>
<p>
She untied the launch while Shirley stepped
aboard and started the engine. Then giving the
boat a shove, Mabel leaped aboard.
</p>
<p>
The engine sputtered once or twice, and then
began to whirr regularly. The launch moved away
from the shore.
</p>
<p>
Under Shirley’s firm hand, it came about in a
wide circle and started upstream. Five minutes
later they were rounding a curve that hid the starting
point.
</p>
<p>
As the boat went round the bend, Mabel looking
back, thought she made out several figures standing
upon the bank. She told her discovery to Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“I guess Jones has discovered that we have escaped,”
said Shirley. “However, we are safe
enough now.”
</p>
<p>
She increased the speed of the little craft, and it
rushed on through the dark and murky water, both
girls keeping a keen lookout ahead.
</p>
<p>
Neither had any idea how far they were from
Paris, for their course had been changed so often.
</p>
<p>
“We’ll just have to keep going until we get there,”
said Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“I expect your father will be terribly worried,”
said Mabel.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_175'></a>175</span>
</p>
<p>
“I know he will,” was the reply. “Poor Dad,
he will think I have fallen into the hands of the
conspirators. He probably has the whole town out
looking for us.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you suppose has happened to Leonard,
Dick and the others?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know. They have probably gone further
down stream. It isn’t likely that they noticed
the <em>Sybil</em> so close to shore.”
</p>
<p>
For hours, it seemed to the two girls, they continued
their journey, and at last the first faint signs
of dawn appeared in the east.
</p>
<p>
“I am glad day is coming,” said Mabel. “We
can see where we are going.”
</p>
<p>
At that moment there came a faint sputtering
from the engine, and then it came to a dead stop.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter?” asked Mabel anxiously.
</p>
<p>
Shirley made a hasty examination.
</p>
<p>
“Fuel supply exhausted,” she said. “No more
gasoline.”
</p>
<p>
“My gracious!” ejaculated Mabel, in dismay.
“What shall we do?”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll have to wait until it’s a little lighter,”
replied her friend, “and then we’ll see if we can’t
paddle ashore. There is no telling how far we
may be from town, but I reckon we shall have to
walk it.”
</p>
<p>
“I suppose there is no help for it,” said Mabel.
“However, we are out of danger.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_176'></a>176</span>
</p>
<p>
The boat stood still in the middle of the stream
for perhaps half an hour, and then both became
conscious of a faint chugging far down the stream.
“Some one coming,” said Mabel, “maybe they will
give us a lift.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps it is Jones,” said Shirley uneasily.
</p>
<p>
“Dear me! I hope not!” sighed Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“So do I. We have had enough trouble for one
day.”
</p>
<p>
They continued to gaze down stream.
</p>
<p>
A few minutes later a second launch came into
view around the bend in the creek. The girls were
able to make out several figures. It was apparent,
also, that the men in the boat had seen them.
</p>
<p>
One stood up, and a faint hail came across the
water.
</p>
<p>
“It must be Jones,” said Mabel. “And he has
seen us, too. What shall we do?”
</p>
<p>
“We’ll try and get ashore,” said Shirley quietly.
</p>
<p>
In the far end of the boat she had seen a pair
of oars. She got these out hurriedly, and set to
work with a will. The <em>Sybil</em> moved shoreward,
slowly at first, and then more swiftly as Shirley
settled herself to her task.
</p>
<p>
Both girls kept close watch on their pursuers.
They could not make out the faces of its occupants—it
was still too dark—nor did they recognize the
voices that hailed them frequently. It was plain,
however, that the pursuing launch was gaining.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_177'></a>177</span>
</p>
<p>
“It must be Jones,” cried Shirley. “Be ready to
jump the minute we run aground, Mabel.”
</p>
<p>
Mabel signified that she understood, and gathering
up her skirts, she stood up in the prow of the
launch.
</p>
<p>
A moment later the little craft grounded with a
shock. Mabel leaped lightly ashore, and turned to
lend Shirley a hand. But this was unnecessary, for
the moment she realized the boat had struck bottom,
Shirley dropped the oars and also sprang
ashore.
</p>
<p>
Quickly she grasped her friend by the hand.
</p>
<p>
“Run!” she cried, and suited the action to the
word.
</p>
<p>
Swiftly the two girls sped over the uneven ground
toward shelter of a dense clump of trees not far
away. And they disappeared among these just as
the second launch grounded and several figures
leaped ashore.
</p>
<p>
The first of the pursuers caught a glimpse of the
two figures disappearing in the woods, and immediately
gave chase. The others followed him.
</p>
<p>
Hearing pursuing footsteps, the girls redoubled
their efforts and were soon, they believed, safe from
pursuit. They sat down quickly, to take a much-needed
rest.
</p>
<p>
There came the sound of footsteps crashing
through the underbrush. Shirley glanced about.
</p>
<p>
“Up in this tree, quick, Mabel,” she exclaimed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_178'></a>178</span>
</p>
<p>
She lent her friend a hand, and a minute later
they were high up among the branches, where they
could peer down without being seen. And at that
moment a voice called out:
</p>
<p>
“Shirley! Mabel!”
</p>
<p>
“My gracious!” exclaimed Mabel. “It’s Leonard.”
</p>
<p>
The girls looked at each other somewhat sheepishly.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_179'></a>179</span><a name='chXXII' id='chXXII'></a>CHAPTER XXII.—SAFE.</h2>
<p>
“Shirley! Mabel!” came Leonard’s voice
again.
</p>
<p>
“Here we are, Leonard,” shouted Mabel.
</p>
<p>
There was a moment’s silence, and then the footsteps
came nearer and Leonard halted directly
under the tree in which the two girls clung.
</p>
<p>
“Where?” he shouted.
</p>
<p>
“Right up here,” replied Mabel, with a giggle.
</p>
<p>
This time Leonard placed the sound of Mabel’s
voice. He glanced up. Far above the ground he
could just make out what he knew must be the two
girls.
</p>
<p>
“Bless my soul!” he exclaimed. “What on earth
are you doing up there?”
</p>
<p>
“Trying to get away from Jones,” replied Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Well, you are safe enough now. Come down.”
</p>
<p>
“All right,” said both girls at once.
</p>
<p>
While Leonard turned back to hail the other
searchers, the two girls slipped from the tree.
Leonard seized the hand of each.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_180'></a>180</span>
</p>
<p>
“Oh!” he exclaimed, “you gave us an awful
scare. If it hadn’t been for Dick, there is no telling
when we might have found you.”
</p>
<p>
“What did Dick do?” asked Shirley eagerly.
</p>
<p>
“Why, he saved us a futile search in the woods.
He figured that it was you who had taken the <em>Sybil</em>
and it was upon his suggestion that we came up
stream again.”
</p>
<p>
“And did you capture Jones?” demanded Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Yes; but he got away again.”
</p>
<p>
“And Jimmy?” asked Shirley eagerly. “Is he
safe?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. He’s around here some place looking for
you.”
</p>
<p>
“Then,” said Mabel, slowly, “it must have been
you we saw on the shore just as we escaped.”
</p>
<p>
“It must have been,” replied Leonard. “I
thought I saw a dark shape going up the creek, but
I wasn’t sure, so I said nothing about it.”
</p>
<p>
“And where did you get the other launch? We
saw nothing of it when we left.”
</p>
<p>
“We found it a mile down stream, about where
we left it when we recaptured the <em>Sybil</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“So that’s the way it was,” said Shirley, half to
herself. “Had we only met you after we escaped
we all would have been saved a lot of worry.”
</p>
<p>
“But why didn’t you stop when I hailed you in
the creek?” asked Leonard, fatigue and anxiety
beginning to tell on his nerves.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_181'></a>181</span>
</p>
<p>
“We thought it was Jones coming after us,”
Mabel explained.
</p>
<p>
“I see,” replied Leonard.
</p>
<p>
At that moment, Dick, Jimmy, Jenkins and the
policemen came running up.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I see you have found them,” said Jenkins.
</p>
<p>
He wiped beads of perspiration from his brow—for
he had been running.
</p>
<p>
“I’m glad of it. I must get home at once, or
my wife will have the entire police force on the
lookout for me.”
</p>
<p>
The others laughed.
</p>
<p>
“Well, that’s what I get for being married,” said
Jenkins. “But come, hustle back into the launch
and we’ll hurry back to town.”
</p>
<p>
“There is no gasoline in the <em>Sybil</em>,” said Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Is that so?” said Jenkins. “Then I’ll have to
hitch her on behind and tow her home.”
</p>
<p>
This was done and the little party was soon
turned toward home.
</p>
<p>
They were closer to Paris than the girls had realized,
and half an hour later they came in sight of
the point from which they had started upon the
long chase the day before.
</p>
<p>
As the boat drew close to the little landing, a
woman with fiery red hair, her sleeves rolled up
and a frown on her face, came hurrying toward
them, and just as Jenkins leaped ashore and tied
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_182'></a>182</span>
the boat up, she seized him by the ear with her
right hand.
</p>
<p>
“Tom Jenkins,” she cried, “it’s about time you
were getting home. What do you mean by running
away from me and not coming back?”
</p>
<p>
“But, Martha,” protested Jenkins, his face turning
red in confusion, “I was only helping these
young people out. One of ’em had been kidnapped,
and——”
</p>
<p>
“And you had to go along and see the fun, I
suppose.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, not exactly,” said Mr. Jenkins. “I——”
</p>
<p>
“You come with me,” said Mrs. Jenkins decisively.
</p>
<p>
She gave Jenkins’ ear a sharp twist, and the latter
howled with pain.
</p>
<p>
“Ow! Leggo my ear!” he screamed.
</p>
<p>
He twitched about, and with effort freed himself
and stepped back.
</p>
<p>
“Let me explain,” he said to his wife.
</p>
<p>
“You can explain when you get to the house,”
said Mrs. Jenkins angrily. “If you ain’t there in
three minutes, I’ll be back after you.”
</p>
<p>
She strode majestically away.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Jenkins rubbed his ear and grinned ruefully.
</p>
<p>
“You see how it is,” he exclaimed. “A man
always gets the worst of it somehow when he gets
mixed up with somebody else’s business.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_183'></a>183</span>
</p>
<p>
“We certainly appreciate your aid, Mr. Jenkins,”
said Shirley, offering her hand, which Jenkins
grasped heartily.
</p>
<p>
The others also shook hands with him.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Mr. Jenkins, “you know I’m glad
to have been of—— All right, Martha, I’m coming!”
</p>
<p>
This last as the voice of his wife once more rang
out with the demand:
</p>
<p>
“Are you coming, Tom Jenkins? Or do I have
to come after you?”
</p>
<p>
He broke off suddenly and hastened toward the
house to meet his spouse, who was coming toward
him with rapid strides.
</p>
<p>
The girls laughed and the others joined them.
</p>
<p>
“Poor old Jenkins,” said Leonard. “I’ll bet he
has a tough time.”
</p>
<p>
“It looks that way,” said Dick, with a faint
smile.
</p>
<p>
He turned to Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Now that you are safe at last,” he said quietly,
“I guess I may as well be going. There is nothing
more for me to do.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley was startled.
</p>
<p>
“Surely you will wait and let my father thank
you?” she said.
</p>
<p>
Dick shook his head.
</p>
<p>
“It’s enough for me to know I have been of
service to you,” he said. “I want no thanks.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_184'></a>184</span>
</p>
<p>
“But,” protested Shirley, “where are you going?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know exactly,” replied the boy. “Back
to Cincinnati, I guess.”
</p>
<p>
“Do your father and mother live there?” asked
the girl.
</p>
<p>
“I have no father and mother,” was the slow response.
</p>
<p>
“Forgive me,” said Shirley impulsively. “I
didn’t know. What are you planning to do?”
</p>
<p>
Again the lad shook his head.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” he said. “I guess I shall find
a job of some kind, though.”
</p>
<p>
“Surely you will not get mixed up with Jones
again?” asked Shirley anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“No,” replied Dick. “I am through with Jones
and his kind forever.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley breathed a sigh of relief.
</p>
<p>
“I am glad to hear that,” she said. “How would
you like to go home with us? I am sure Dad can
find something for you to do on the farm.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you,” replied Dick. “I am sorry, but I
must decline.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley gave it up.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” she said, “you must decide for yourself.
But I do want to thank you for the aid you have
given us, and I shall always be glad to see you.”
</p>
<p>
Dick bowed. The others approached and shook
hands with him, and then he turned to go.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_185'></a>185</span>
</p>
<p>
“Come and see us when you can, or at least let
us hear from you,” Shirley called after him.
</p>
<p>
Dick turned and bowed once more. Shirley
waved her hand to him, and a moment later he
disappeared.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Leonard, “there is no use standing
here. Let us get home.”
</p>
<p>
They started up town. At Main Street the two
officers left them.
</p>
<p>
“1 guess we are due for a wigging from the
chief,” said one.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said the other. “It was worth it.”
</p>
<p>
Leonard, Jimmy and the two girls bade the officers
good-bye and made their way to Wilson’s
drug store. Mr. Wilson himself came running to
the door as they approached.
</p>
<p>
“Where have you been?” he demanded. “Your
father has been scouring the town for you. He is
almost frantic.”
</p>
<p>
“We have been rescuing Jimmy,” replied Shirley.
“Where is Dad now?”
</p>
<p>
“I guess he is at the police station.”
</p>
<p>
“Then he’ll be back in a few minutes,” said
Shirley. “The officers will tell him where we are.”
</p>
<p>
Her prophecy proved correct, and five minutes
later Mr. Willing dashed breathlessly into the store.
</p>
<p>
“Shirley,” he cried, and clasped his daughter in
his arms.
</p>
<p>
“You almost frightened your father to death,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_186'></a>186</span>
he said, releasing her at last. “Where have you
been?”
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t the officers tell you?” demanded Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“They tried to tell me something,” was the reply,
“but I didn’t wait to hear them when I learned that
you were safe.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley related their adventures and Mr. Willing
listened attentively.
</p>
<p>
“I must put the police after this man Jones,” he
said, when Shirley had concluded.
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t do that, Dad,” said Shirley. “It’s all
over now, and there is no use causing more talk.”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know but what you are right,” agreed
Mr. Willing after a pause. “Besides, I guess we
shall hear no more of him.”
</p>
<p>
“I am sure we shall not,” agreed Shirley.
</p>
<p>
But in this, as we shall see later, all were mistaken.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_187'></a>187</span><a name='chXXIII' id='chXXIII'></a>CHAPTER XXIII.—TREACHERY.</h2>
<p>
Young Leonard Wolfe, returning from town two
days later, approached Mr. Willing with visible
excitement.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter?” demanded the latter, eyeing
the young man curiously.
</p>
<p>
“Matter enough, sir. I saw Jones in town.”
</p>
<p>
“What!” exclaimed Mr. Willing. “I didn’t think
he would have the nerve to show his face in these
parts again.”
</p>
<p>
“Nevertheless he was there, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Did he see you?”
</p>
<p>
“No, sir. I’ll warrant he is up to some mischief.”
</p>
<p>
“Undoubtedly,” replied Mr. Willing. “We shall
have to be watchful. Gabriel must be guarded
every moment of the day and night.”
</p>
<p>
“My idea exactly, sir,” replied Leonard.
</p>
<p>
Shirley approached, and noticing the uneasiness
of Leonard and her father, she asked what was
the trouble. Leonard explained.
</p>
<p>
“He is surely planning more mischief,” exclaimed Shirley.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_188'></a>188</span>
“Gabriel must be guarded closely.”
</p>
<p>
“Exactly what we had decided upon,” declared
Leonard. “Somebody, armed, must be near him all
the time. I am willing to stand one watch.”
</p>
<p>
“Good,” said Mr. Willing. “Jimmy, too, is
ready. Now I believe the best thing to do is to
split the day and night into three parts—each watch
eight hours.”
</p>
<p>
“But who will stand the third watch, Dad?”
asked Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Frank,” declared Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“But Uncle Frank is so old,” protested Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“He’s not too old to use a shotgun,” replied
Mr. Willing significantly. “Besides, I feel sure I
can trust him.”
</p>
<p>
“I am sure of that,” replied Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Call him for me, daughter,” said Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
Shirley went on this errand, and a few moments
later “Uncle Frank,” an old negro, stood before
them.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing explained the situation in a few
words and Uncle Frank announced himself as not
only willing but eager to stand one of the watches.
</p>
<p>
“Leonard,” said Mr. Willing, “you stand the first
watch, from six o’clock in the morning until two.
Jimmy can watch from two until ten, and Frank,
you stand guard from ten until six in the morning.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing glanced at his watch.
</p>
<p>
“It is now almost noon,” he said. “Leonard,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_189'></a>189</span>
you go to the stable and relieve Jimmy until two
o’clock. In the meantime, I’ll get out my double-barreled
shotgun and clean it up a bit.”
</p>
<p>
Leonard did as Mr. Willing requested.
</p>
<p>
The next two days passed quietly, and every one
had about come to the conclusion that there was
nothing more to be feared.
</p>
<p>
Gabriel was being given a short workout every
day now, to prime him for the great Derby. Each
morning and afternoon Jimmy put him through a
stiff run along Willing’s trial track, and Mr. Willing,
after examining the racehorse carefully, announced
that he was in fine condition.
</p>
<p>
“He’s on edge right now,” he declared. “We
mustn’t train him too fine, but we must give him
enough work to keep him from growing stale.”
</p>
<p>
The date for the big Derby was fast approaching.
Experts and racing men from all over the
country came to the Willing farm almost daily, seeking
to have a look at Gabriel, who had been picked
almost unanimously to win the big race.
</p>
<p>
In spite of the fact that Gabriel had never been
entered against horses of such class before, his
fame had gone before him, for in some manner, in
spite of the fact that an effort was made to keep
his time in trial runs secret, it had leaked out, and
there was little question that Gabriel would be the
favorite upon the day of the Derby.
</p>
<p>
But to the experts and racehorse men who pleaded
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_190'></a>190</span>
to look at the great black horse, Mr. Willing turned
a deaf ear.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll see him in action in the Derby,” he said.
</p>
<p>
With this the visitors had to be satisfied.
</p>
<p>
“Monday,” said Mr. Willing to Shirley and the
others, “we must start for Louisville. We want
to be on the ground at least a week before the day
of the race. Besides, Gabriel must have that time
to recover from the effects of the trip.”
</p>
<p>
“Have you made your arrangements for stabling
at the track?” asked Leonard.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. I shall have the same quarters as in years
past. This year, however, I shall take no other
horses, as has been the custom heretofore. I do not
feel that I have another horse in my string that is
sure to win a race, so I shall content myself with
winning the Derby.”
</p>
<p>
“And Gabriel will win,” declared Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Let us hope so,” said Leonard sincerely.
</p>
<p>
This conversation took place the Wednesday
morning before the Monday set for the departure.
</p>
<p>
“Daddy,” said Shirley the following afternoon,
“I haven’t ridden Gabriel for a long time. Can’t
I work him out to-day?”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing hesitated.
</p>
<p>
“Why, I see no reason why you cannot,” he said
finally. “I know Gabriel loves you, and perhaps
will do more for you than he will even for Jimmy.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley clapped her hands and ran toward the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_191'></a>191</span>
stable, where she informed Jimmy of her father’s
decision.
</p>
<p>
“All right, Miss Shirley,” smiled Jimmy. “I
know Gabriel will be glad to have you ride him.”
</p>
<p>
“I wish I were going to ride him in the Derby,”
declared Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“If you did,” said Jimmy, “the result would
never be in doubt. With you on his back, Gabriel
would be the first under the wire if he dropped over
dead a moment later.”
</p>
<p>
Leaning forward upon Gabriel’s neck, Shirley
patted the horse gently. Gabriel did not respond to
this loving touch with a whinny of pleasure, as was
his wont.
</p>
<p>
Instead he shook his head angrily, and stamped
his feet. His jaws worked up and down violently
and he champed at the bit.
</p>
<p>
“What on earth ails him?” demanded Shirley in
surprise.
</p>
<p>
“I guess he is just anxious to be on the go,” was
the lad’s reply.
</p>
<p>
“I never saw him act like that before,” said
Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Nor I. But I guess he will be all right after
he gets out on the track and gets to going.”
</p>
<p>
Jimmy walked ahead of Shirley and opened the
gates for her.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t let him out too much,” he warned her.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_192'></a>192</span>
“Just a nice even walk-out is all he needs. Don’t
run him too hard.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley nodded that she understood. Jimmy
stepped back, and Shirley, leaning forward once
more, again patted the noble animal’s head. A moment
later they were off down the track at a swift
trot.
</p>
<p>
They had hardly disappeared around the first
turn when a man appeared suddenly from behind a
big tree and laid his hand on Jimmy’s arm. Jimmy
whirled about.
</p>
<p>
“Jones!” he exclaimed in the utmost surprise.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Jones,” said the other with a smile. “I
just came out to have a look at Gabriel. Before I
go back I just wanted to tell you that I do not need
your services for the success of my plan.”
</p>
<p>
Jimmy stepped close to Jones and doubled up his
fists.
</p>
<p>
“You get off this place immediately,” he said
angrily.
</p>
<p>
Jones laughed at him.
</p>
<p>
“I suppose you will put me off if I don’t,” he
sneered. “Oh, well, I am going, so don’t worry.”
</p>
<p>
He turned on his heel and stalked away.
</p>
<p>
And at that moment Shirley flashed by on Gabriel.
Down the track she had seen Jimmy in
conversation with a stranger, and as she whirled by
she caught sight of Jones’ face, and recognized
him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_193'></a>193</span>
</p>
<p>
“Strange,” she muttered. “What can he be talking
to Jimmy about?”
</p>
<p>
And as she continued around the course Gabriel’s
actions steadily became more peculiar. Twice Shirley
urged him to renewed efforts, but after a short
spurt he slowed down quickly. And as he ran he
shook his head violently from side to side and
champed more fiercely at his bit.
</p>
<p>
“Something wrong,” thought Shirley. “One
more round and then back to the stable.”
</p>
<p>
On this last round Gabriel slowed down considerably
and in spite of all Shirley’s urging he refused
to increase his pace. At the gate this time
Shirley turned out, and made for the stable.
</p>
<p>
Jimmy had preceded her there, and was waiting
as she rode up. Mr. Willing, Leonard, Mr. Ashton
and Mabel also stood near.
</p>
<p>
“Well, how does he go, daughter?” demanded
Mr. Willing, as Shirley flung herself to the ground.
</p>
<p>
“There is something the matter with him,” said
Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?” asked Mr. Willing quickly,
and stepped forward.
</p>
<p>
He glanced searchingly at Gabriel, and just then
the noble horse staggered.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing sprang forward with a cry of alarm.
</p>
<p>
“Help me get this bridle off immediately,” he
shouted.
</p>
<p>
Jimmy and Shirley sprang to do his bidding.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_194'></a>194</span>
</p>
<p>
The bridle came away in Mr. Willing’s hands a
moment later, and the latter examined it carefully.
Gabriel, in the meantime, walking very slowly, made
for his stall.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing turned from his examination of the
bridle. He held the bit in his hand.
</p>
<p>
“I was sure I could not be mistaken,” he said
quietly. “I have seen too many such cases.”
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean, Dad?” said Shirley in
alarm.
</p>
<p>
The others also turned to him anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“Gabriel’s bit,” said Mr. Willing calmly, holding
it aloft, “has been painted.”
</p>
<p>
“Painted!” cried Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. That is the reason you noticed there was
something wrong with him. That is the reason
he staggered a moment ago. He is sick. Now,
who is responsible for this piece of treachery?”
</p>
<p>
For a moment there was no reply. Then Shirley,
taking a long breath, stepped forward.
</p>
<p>
“Jimmy,” she said quietly, “did I not see you
talking with Mr. Jones a few moments ago?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, Miss Shirley,” replied the boy, realizing
what was coming.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing stepped forward with a cry of
anger.
</p>
<p>
“Jones on my place again?” he demanded. “Why
didn’t you tell me?”
</p>
<p>
“I didn’t want to worry you, sir,” replied the boy.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_195'></a>195</span>
</p>
<p>
“Didn’t want to worry me, eh?” Mr. Willing’s
face grew red with anger. He pointed sternly toward
the pike. “You,” he said to Jimmy, “get your
clothes right now and get off this place before I
throw you off.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley buried her face in her hands.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_196'></a>196</span><a name='chXXIV' id='chXXIV'></a>CHAPTER XXIV.—AN ACCIDENT AND A CONFESSION.</h2>
<p>
Jimmy opened his mouth to speak, then bowed his
head and turned away.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be too hard on the boy, Willing,” said
Mr. Ashton, taking a step forward.
</p>
<p>
“Hard on him!” repeated Mr. Willing. “How
can I be too hard on him? The little scoundrel has
sold me out.”
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps he is not to blame,” said Leonard.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing turned upon him.
</p>
<p>
“There have been too many of you trying to run
my affairs,” he said angrily. “In the future, I
shall attend to them myself.”
</p>
<p>
He turned and strode rapidly toward the house
where he immediately telephoned for a veterinary
to come out and look at Gabriel. Then he went to
his own room, where he sat down, pulled out a
cigar, and smoked in silence.
</p>
<p>
“I wish I hadn’t spoken,” moaned Shirley, as her
father walked away. “Poor Jimmy! Perhaps he is
not to blame, after all.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_197'></a>197</span>
</p>
<p>
“Still,” said Mr. Ashton, “appearances are much
against him, particularly after what has gone on
before. Certainly Jones would not have approached
him again unless he had reason to believe that
Jimmy would accept his offer.”
</p>
<p>
“It does look that way,” agreed Leonard.
</p>
<p>
But Shirley refused to be comforted.
</p>
<p>
“It’s all my fault,” she cried, and ran to the house,
where she threw herself down upon her bed and
gave way to tears.
</p>
<p>
There Mabel found her half an hour later and
tried to soothe her.
</p>
<p>
“There, there,” she said, stroking her friend’s
head. “It will all come out right in the end. If
Jimmy is guilty he should be put off the place. If
he isn’t, it will be proven.”
</p>
<p>
“I know he isn’t!” cried Shirley. “I knew it the
minute I spoke. Oh, why did I say anything?”
</p>
<p>
“You did perfectly right,” declared Mabel.
</p>
<p>
Suddenly Shirley sprang to her feet.
</p>
<p>
“Has Jimmy gone yet?” she asked, drying her
tears as she spoke.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” replied Mabel.
</p>
<p>
Shirley hurried out the door.
</p>
<p>
“I must see him before he goes,” she exclaimed.
“Come, maybe we can find him.”
</p>
<p>
The girls left the room hurriedly, and made their
way to the front of the house. There, trudging
slowly toward the pike-gate, with a bundle over his
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_198'></a>198</span>
shoulder, they made out the slight form of Jimmy
Smith.
</p>
<p>
“Jimmy!” called Shirley, but the boy did not look
back.
</p>
<p>
Shirley ran after him, and Mabel followed her
friend.
</p>
<p>
Hearing footsteps behind him, Jimmy turned and
looked back. Perceiving Shirley, he faced about
again and would have gone on had not the girl
called to him.
</p>
<p>
“Wait a minute, Jimmy.”
</p>
<p>
Jimmy halted and waited until Shirley came up
to him.
</p>
<p>
“Jimmy,” cried the girl, “can you ever forgive
me? I know you are not guilty.”
</p>
<p>
“No,” said Jimmy quietly, “I am not guilty. It
is true I talked to Jones, but he did not even suggest
treachery to me.”
</p>
<p>
“I know it! I know it!” declared Shirley. “And
it is my fault that Dad has acted so.”
</p>
<p>
“It was your duty to your father, Miss Shirley,”
declared the lad.
</p>
<p>
“It is good of you to say so,” declared the girl,
“but what shall we do?”
</p>
<p>
“I shall find employment in town,” said Jimmy.
“Some day, perhaps, your father will learn that he
has misjudged me.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll make him see it,” declared Shirley. “You
shall yet win the Derby with Gabriel.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_199'></a>199</span>
</p>
<p>
Jimmy smiled sadly.
</p>
<p>
“I am afraid it is impossible,” he replied.
“Should you ever need me, Mr. Wilson will tell you
where to find me. I shall leave my address with
him. Good-bye.”
</p>
<p>
He turned again, and before Shirley could protest,
had continued on his way. For long minutes
the girl looked after him, and then, stifling a sob, she
made her way back toward the house.
</p>
<p>
A sudden cry of anguish came from the direction
of the stable. Shirley listened intently, and heard
another scream.
</p>
<p>
Shirley dashed in the direction from which it had
come.
</p>
<p>
Reaching the stable she paused for a moment, listening.
Nothing but silence. But as she was about
to move on again, a low groan caught her ear.
Again she listened. It came from Gabriel’s stall.
</p>
<p>
Shirley hastened forward.
</p>
<p>
From Gabriel’s stall protruded Gabriel’s black
head. His eyes flamed angrily and he uttered snorts
of rage.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter, Gabriel?” asked Shirley, and
ran forward.
</p>
<p>
Gabriel gave a low whinny, and the fire left his
eyes. Shirley opened the stall door and stepped
inside. And she drew back with a cry of fear.
</p>
<p>
In the far corner of the stall lay a human form,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_200'></a>200</span>
twisted and out of shape. Shirley ran quickly toward
it, and started back with a cry:
</p>
<p>
“Uncle Frank!”
</p>
<p>
There was no reply from the silent form. Stooping
hastily, Shirley laid hold of the shoulders and
dragged the body from the stall, closing the door
behind her. Then she bent over the still figure.
</p>
<p>
The face was caked with blood, and the arms
and limbs hung limp. A moment and Uncle Frank’s
eyes opened and he gave vent to a feeble groan.
</p>
<p>
Shirley laid him down gently, and ran toward
the house.
</p>
<p>
“Dad!” she cried. “Dad! Gabriel has killed
Uncle Frank!”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing roused from his reverie with a start
and hurried to the stable. Others who had heard
Shirley’s words followed him. Soon every human
being on the place was crowding around the stable.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing arrived first, and bent over the form
of his old servant.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter, Frank?” he asked gently.
</p>
<p>
“Gabriel,” gasped the old negro, whose senses had
now come back to him. “Gabriel! He dun kill
me!”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, it’s not as bad as all that,” replied Mr. Willing
hopefully. He turned to the crowd of negroes
gathered about. “Telephone for Dr. Thompson,
quick, one of you. Here,” motioning to two others,
“help me carry him to the house.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_201'></a>201</span>
</p>
<p>
Gently the old darky was picked up and carried
to the house, where Mr. Willing laid him upon a
sofa on the porch.
</p>
<p>
Uncle Frank was perfectly conscious now.
</p>
<p>
“How did it happen, Frank?” asked Mr. Willing.
“Surely you knew Gabriel wouldn’t allow
you in his stall.”
</p>
<p>
“Yessah. But I went—I went in anyhow.”
</p>
<p>
“Why?”
</p>
<p>
Uncle Frank did not reply. He began to cough.
</p>
<p>
“Take off his coat, Dad,” exclaimed Shirley.
</p>
<p>
Gently they raised the old negro, and Mr. Willing
took hold of his coat. Uncle Frank protested
vigorously, but Mr. Willing drew the garment off
anyhow, and threw it to a chair across the room.
</p>
<p>
It left a trail of greenbacks upon the floor.
</p>
<p>
Greatly surprised, Shirley stooped and picked
them up, and, unthinkingly, counted them.
</p>
<p>
“Five hundred dollars,” she exclaimed. “Where
in the world did he get all this money?”
</p>
<p>
She considered the point for some minutes, and
then exclaimed aloud.
</p>
<p>
“Look, Dad,” she said, and handed him the roll
of bills. “These dropped out of Uncle Frank’s
pocket.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing looked at his daughter in astonishment.
</p>
<p>
“Where on earth did he get that money?” he exclaimed.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_202'></a>202</span>
</p>
<p>
Shirley smiled slightly.
</p>
<p>
“Unless I am greatly mistaken,” she said, “this
is the same five hundred dollars Mr. Jones offered
Jimmy Smith if he would ‘pull’ Gabriel in the
Derby.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing seemed staggered.
</p>
<p>
“Impossible!” he exclaimed. “Why, Frank has
been with me for years. He is as faithful as the
day is long.”
</p>
<p>
“Will he get well?” asked Shirley abruptly.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing shook his head.
</p>
<p>
“There is no chance,” he replied. “I knew
enough to see that. Hardly a rib in his body but
is broken. Also, he is badly crushed internally. No,
he will not live.”
</p>
<p>
“Then,” said Shirley, “he must be made to clear
Jimmy before he dies.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing was silent for a long time.
</p>
<p>
“It is hard to believe,” he said at last, “but you
must be right.”
</p>
<p>
He approached the bed.
</p>
<p>
“Frank,” he said quietly, “why did you sell me
out?”
</p>
<p>
The old negro rolled his eyes but did not reply.
</p>
<p>
“Frank,” said Mr. Willing again, “you are going
to die.”
</p>
<p>
“No! No!” cried the old negro.
</p>
<p>
“It is true,” continued Mr. Willing. “Now,
Frank, haven’t I always treated you all right?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_203'></a>203</span>
</p>
<p>
“Yessah!”
</p>
<p>
“Then tell me why you sold me out.”
</p>
<p>
Still the old negro was silent.
</p>
<p>
“Frank,” said Mr. Willing, “did you put the
painted bit in Gabriel’s stall?”
</p>
<p>
The old negro nodded.
</p>
<p>
“Yessah.”
</p>
<p>
He turned his head and sobbed.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t question him any more, Dad,” said Shirley,
also with tears in her eyes. “It is enough that
we know Jimmy is innocent. Let him die in peace.”
</p>
<p>
Suddenly Frank half rose in the bed, and a fit
of coughing shook him.
</p>
<p>
“The end is near,” said Mr. Willing quietly.
“The doctor will be too late.”
</p>
<p>
The old negro drew himself up high in the bed,
and gazed at Mr. Willing. Then, slowly, hesitatingly,
he extended an old and wrinkled hand.
</p>
<p>
“Good-bye, suh,” he said, in a low voice. “I’se
sorry.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing took the hand without a word. A
smile lighted up the old negro’s face. Then, suddenly,
he fell back.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing bent over him.
</p>
<p>
“He is dead,” he said, and his voice broke.
</p>
<p>
Shirley turned quietly toward the door.
</p>
<p>
“Where are you going?” demanded Mr. Willing,
in a low voice.
</p>
<p>
“I am going to bring Jimmy back.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_204'></a>204</span><a name='chXXV' id='chXXV'></a>CHAPTER XXV.—SHIRLEY SAVES JIMMY FROM HIMSELF.</h2>
<p>
Arrived in Paris, Shirley went at once to Mr.
Wilson’s drug store.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” said Mr. Wilson, in response to Shirley’s
question. “Jimmy left me this address.”
</p>
<p>
He drew a card from his pocket and passed it to
Shirley. The young girl glanced at it and then
uttered an exclamation of surprise.
</p>
<p>
The address was the same hotel as that in which
Jones had stopped when Jimmy fell into his power.
</p>
<p>
“There was a man with him when he gave me
the card,” Mr. Wilson continued.
</p>
<p>
“Please describe him,” said Shirley anxiously.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Wilson did so, and Shirley maintained her
composure with difficulty.
</p>
<p>
“Jones,” said Shirley to herself as she made her
way from the store.
</p>
<p>
For a moment she hesitated, but for a moment
only. Then mounting her horse, she set out resolutely
for the address given. She climbed the dark
stairs and went at once to the room Jones had occupied
the last time she had been there.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_205'></a>205</span>
</p>
<p>
Just as she was about to knock she caught the
sound of voices from the inside. One she immediately
recognized as Jones’ and the other was
Jimmy’s. Shirley listened.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Jones, “I am glad to see that you
have come to your senses at last. It’s about time.”
</p>
<p>
“I guess you are right,” said Jimmy, and to Shirley
the voice sounded somewhat listless.
</p>
<p>
“You will find,” said Jones, “that in the long
run the only friend you have is yourself. You
see how quick Willing jumped onto you—also his
daughter. No matter how honest you may be, at
the first sign of dishonesty you are kicked out,
guilty or innocent.”
</p>
<p>
“You’re right,” said Jimmy. “I guess I might
as well have the game as the name. Now what is
it you want me to do?”
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Jones, “we worked the painted bit
trick too soon. The horse will have recovered in
time for the race. We must find some other way of
getting at him. Do you know when Willing will
move him to Louisville?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes. He will be driven into Paris Monday
morning, and shipped that night.”
</p>
<p>
“Good. Then it will be your work to try and
slip into the car unobserved. I shall give you a
certain powder which you can give the horse. I’ll
guarantee a dose of it will lay him up for a month.”
</p>
<p>
Jimmy shuddered slightly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_206'></a>206</span>
</p>
<p>
“It seems a shabby trick to play on Gabriel,” he
said.
</p>
<p>
“Well, it’s a shabby trick Willing played on you.”
</p>
<p>
“So it is,” agreed Jimmy. “But suppose there is
another guard with the horse? I may not be able
to get in.”
</p>
<p>
“In that event I’ll take you to Louisville. A
chance will turn up there sooner or later. You see
the trouble is that no one but you can go close to
him.”
</p>
<p>
“Then how will Mr. Willing race him?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, he’ll find a jockey some place. They’ll
bridle the horse some way, and once on his back one
jockey will ride him as well as another.”
</p>
<p>
“I’m not so sure about that,” said Jimmy, “but
maybe you’re right.”
</p>
<p>
“I know I am. It has been done many a time.
Well, how does the plan strike you?”
</p>
<p>
“And you say,” said Jimmy, “that if I am successful,
you will pay me $500?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes; as soon as the race is over.”
</p>
<p>
“Then I accept.”
</p>
<p>
“Good. I thought you would come to your
senses.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley had listened in horror to this conversation.
She could scarcely believe her ears. She
had never dreamed that Jimmy would come to this.
And she scolded herself roundly, for she believed
it was all her fault.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_207'></a>207</span>
</p>
<p>
“I brought him to this,” she told herself. “Now
I shall have to save him.”
</p>
<p>
With a sudden movement she pushed open the
door and stepped inside.
</p>
<p>
Jones, who had sat with his back to the door,
jumped to his feet and faced the intruder. Jimmy,
at first sight of Shirley, had turned white; but he
kept his seat.
</p>
<p>
“Jimmy,” cried Shirley, rushing up to him,
“surely you do not mean what you have said.”
</p>
<p>
Jimmy did not reply.
</p>
<p>
“Of course, he means it,” declared Jones, striding
forward. “Why shouldn’t he, after the way
you people have treated him?”
</p>
<p>
Shirley ignored Jones, and again spoke to Jimmy.
</p>
<p>
“We have done you a great injustice,” she said
simply, “and Dad and I are both as sorry as we
can be. I have come to take you back home.”
</p>
<p>
Jimmy looked at her in great surprise.
</p>
<p>
“Take me home?” he repeated. “Has Mr. Willing
discovered his error?”
</p>
<p>
“Frank has confessed,” said Shirley quietly. “He
is dead.”
</p>
<p>
“Frank dead!” echoed Jimmy, springing to his
feet.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. Gabriel killed him.”
</p>
<p>
Jimmy bowed his head.
</p>
<p>
“It is retribution,” he said slowly. “The same
thing might have happened to me.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_208'></a>208</span>
</p>
<p>
Shirley now drew a roll of bills from her purse—the
five hundred dollars she had picked up in
her father’s bedroom when it fell from Uncle
Frank’s pocket. She had brought it with her unconsciously.
</p>
<p>
She threw the roll of money on the table, and
turned to Jones scornfully.
</p>
<p>
“There,” she said, “is your blood money. Come,
Jimmy.”
</p>
<p>
Slowly Jimmy rose to his feet.
</p>
<p>
But as the lad started to follow Shirley through
the door, Jones sprang forward.
</p>
<p>
“No you don’t,” he said. “I have had enough
of this foolishness.” He stepped back quickly, and
from his hip pocket produced a revolver.
</p>
<p>
“Now,” he said, “you sit down in this chair, or
I’ll use this.”
</p>
<p>
Jimmy was a lad of discretion. He sat down.
</p>
<p>
Shirley turned back from the door.
</p>
<p>
“Now,” said Jones, “I want you to understand
that I am not to be trifled with. You are not going
to ride Gabriel in the Derby, not if I have to shoot
you. Is that plain enough?”
</p>
<p>
“It’s plain enough,” said Jimmy.
</p>
<p>
Jones leaned back in his chair and laughed; then
he laid the revolver on the table.
</p>
<p>
“Good,” he said. He turned to Shirley and
waved his hand. “You see,” he said, “Jimmy elects
to remain here.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_209'></a>209</span>
</p>
<p>
“I don’t believe it,” declared Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“No, Miss Shirley,” said Jimmy, “I don’t want
to remain here, but it looks as though I should have
to.”
</p>
<p>
“You don’t want to, eh?” said Jones angrily.
“Well, I’ll make you want to remain.”
</p>
<p>
Leaning suddenly forward, he threw out his right
hand and clutched Jimmy by the collar. With a
violent jerk he pulled him from his seat clear across
the table.
</p>
<p>
Jimmy squirmed and wriggled, but he could not
shake himself free. His kicking feet sent the revolver
from the table to the floor, but Jones did
not notice it.
</p>
<p>
Holding Jimmy high in the air with his left hand,
with his right he deliberately struck him three
heavy blows in the face. Then he let him drop to
the floor, where the lad lay unconscious.
</p>
<p>
“There,” said Jones, “I guess that will settle
you.”
</p>
<p>
“And I guess this will settle you,” came Shirley’s
low voice.
</p>
<p>
Turning suddenly, Jones stepped back. Shirley
stood facing him with one outstretched arm, and
in her hand she clutched the revolver, which she
levelled directly at Jones’ head.
</p>
<p>
Jumping quickly around the table just as Jones
had dropped Jimmy to the floor, Shirley pounced
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_210'></a>210</span>
upon the revolver and rose with it in a steady hand,
as Jones turned.
</p>
<p>
“Now,” she said quietly, keeping the weapon
levelled squarely at the man’s head, “pick Jimmy
up and walk out of here ahead of me.”
</p>
<p>
Jones hesitated and Shirley’s finger tightened
upon the trigger.
</p>
<p>
“I would advise you to do as I say without delay,”
she said.
</p>
<p>
Jones hesitated for only a second longer; then,
stooping over, he lifted the boy up in his arms and
walked out the door.
</p>
<p>
Keeping the revolver ready, Shirley followed him.
</p>
<p>
Shirley had left the horse just outside the hotel.
Jones stopped near the animal.
</p>
<p>
“Put him across the saddle,” Shirley commanded.
</p>
<p>
Jones obeyed.
</p>
<p>
“Now,” said the girl, “take yourself away from
here just as quick as you can.”
</p>
<p>
Without a word Jones turned and walked
rapidly down the street.
</p>
<p>
Shirley climbed to the saddle, and taking the reins
in her right hand, she clutched Jimmy’s inert body
with her left.
</p>
<p>
The girl had no means of telling how badly the
lad was hurt, and her one thought was to get him
to a doctor as quickly as possible. It was getting
late now, and dusk was coming on.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_211'></a>211</span>
</p>
<p>
“I guess I had better take him to Mr. Wilson’s,”
said the girl to herself.
</p>
<p>
She turned her horse in that direction.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Wilson himself came running out of the
door as Shirley dismounted, and lent a hand to
carry Jimmy’s unconscious body into the store,
where they laid him down gently on a sofa in the
rear.
</p>
<p>
Shirley bent over Jimmy anxiously.
</p>
<p>
“Is he badly hurt, Mr. Wilson?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“I am afraid he is,” was the slow reply. “His
face is badly battered, as you can see. He must
have been struck a terrible blow. How did it happen?”
</p>
<p>
Shirley explained.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll call a doctor immediately,” said Mr. Wilson
and hastened to the telephone.
</p>
<p>
The physician arrived a few minutes later.
</p>
<p>
“He must be taken to the hospital,” he declared.
“His condition is serious.”
</p>
<p>
“Can I do anything, doctor?” asked Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“No, not now,” was the reply.
</p>
<p>
“Then I shall go home immediately,” said the
girl.
</p>
<p>
She left the store quickly, mounted her horse,
and headed homeward through the rapidly gathering
darkness.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_212'></a>212</span><a name='chXXVI' id='chXXVI'></a>CHAPTER XXVI.—OFF TO THE DERBY.</h2>
<p>
Mr. Willing’s anger at the manner in which
Jimmy had been injured knew no bounds. It was
late when Shirley reached home, but her father
wanted to go to town at once and put the police on
Jones’ trail.
</p>
<p>
“I don’t think it is necessary, Dad,” said Shirley.
“I feel sure he will trouble us no more.”
</p>
<p>
“But who will ride Gabriel in the Derby?” demanded
Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps Jimmy will be well enough to ride
when the time comes,” suggested Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“I shall call up the doctor the first thing in the
morning and ask the extent of his injuries,” promised
Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“If possible,” said Shirley, “I think it would be
best to take Jimmy to Louisville with us. We can
attend to him carefully there, and help to get him
in condition for the race.”
</p>
<p>
“A good idea,” agreed Mr. Willing, “if the doctor
will consent.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_213'></a>213</span>
</p>
<p>
“I am sure Jimmy will be all right,” said Shirley
hopefully. “By the way, Dad, how is Gabriel?”
</p>
<p>
“Better than could be expected,” was the reply.
“The veterinary said he would be perfectly fit in a
day or two.”
</p>
<p>
After a few further words, all retired with the
exception of Leonard, who made his way to the
stable, where he was to stand watch, for Mr. Willing
had not selected a man to take old Frank’s place.
</p>
<p>
In the morning Mr. Willing learned that Jimmy’s
condition was not as serious as had been feared.
The doctor did not oppose the plan of taking the
lad to Louisville on Monday.
</p>
<p>
“The trip will not hurt him,” he declared. “But
keep him perfectly quiet after you arrive. With
careful nursing he should be in shape to ride Gabriel
to victory.”
</p>
<p>
The days passed slowly, but at last the time for
departure came. Besides packing her own clothes,
Shirley also packed Jimmy’s things, and on Monday
afternoon Mr. Willing, Mr. Ashton, Leonard,
Mabel and Shirley, with Gabriel tied to the rear
of the double carriage, were driven to Paris.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing had already shipped his large touring
car to Louisville, for he believed he would have
need of it there.
</p>
<p>
Leonard had asked to travel with Gabriel and
Mr. Willing, after some hesitancy, had accepted his
offer.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_214'></a>214</span>
</p>
<p>
The party went first to the freight depot, where
Gabriel was led into a car that had been reserved
for him. He was tied up at one end, and Leonard
took up his position at the other. Besides Mr. Willing’s
shotgun the young man was armed with a
brace of heavy caliber revolvers.
</p>
<p>
“The first man that sticks his head in this car
is likely to get it shot off,” said the young man grimly,
as the others prepared to leave.
</p>
<p>
“I am glad that you are here,” said Mr. Willing
slowly. “I am glad to have some one I can trust
in charge of Gabriel. We will be waiting for you
when you reach Louisville.”
</p>
<p>
They shook hands all around and left Gabriel
and Leonard alone. Immediately the car door was
closed, and a few moments later a switch engine
hooked onto the car and soon it was coupled to a
long train. Half an hour later the train began to
move.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime the others had made their way
to the hospital where Jimmy lay. The boy was
much better than they had expected to find him,
and the doctor, who was at the bedside, assured
them that he was well on the road to recovery.
</p>
<p>
“Just be careful with him,” he told them.
</p>
<p>
Jimmy was carried to the depot on a stretcher
and made comfortable in a Pullman car; and soon
the party were on their way.
</p>
<p>
At Lexington there was a long delay, and it was
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_215'></a>215</span>
nearly midnight before the train pulled out. Shirley
and Mabel took turns watching over Jimmy during
the night, but their vigilance was unnecessary.
For the lad, once he had closed his eyes, did not
open them again until the train was nearing Louisville
the following morning.
</p>
<p>
“Where shall we stop, Dad?” asked Shirley, as
they prepared to leave the train.
</p>
<p>
“Guess we may as well go to the St. Charles,”
was the reply.
</p>
<p>
On the platform he summoned a porter, who
picked Jimmy up and carried him to a taxi. Mr.
Willing climbed in alongside him, and Mr. Ashton
and the two girls occupied another.
</p>
<p>
At the hotel Mr. Willing engaged a suite of six
rooms, where all could be comfortable.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll stay here until Saturday,” he told the others.
“Then I shall stay at the track.”
</p>
<p>
This was Tuesday morning, and the Derby would
not be run till the next Monday. In the days that
followed, the two girls, when they were not caring
for Jimmy, spent their time sight-seeing around
town.
</p>
<p>
Leonard and Gabriel arrived Wednesday afternoon,
and Mr. Willing immediately quartered them
in his stable at the track, Leonard announcing that
he had determined to maintain his watch until the
last moment. Shirley and Mabel made several trips
to see the horse, and, of course, so did Mr. Willing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_216'></a>216</span>
There was no doubt in the minds of any that the
animal was in perfect condition for the race.
</p>
<p>
“If Jimmy only gets well in time,” said Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
The youngster was improving steadily and there
seemed little doubt that he would be well enough to
ride by Monday.
</p>
<p>
As Shirley and Mabel were walking along Market
Street Thursday afternoon, the former suddenly
caught sight of a familiar figure in the crowd. She
took Mabel by the hand and hurried forward.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter?” demanded her friend.
</p>
<p>
“I see some one I want to talk to,” was the reply,
and the girl quickened her steps.
</p>
<p>
And then Mabel saw the reason for her chum’s
haste. At the same moment Shirley called:
</p>
<p>
“Dick!”
</p>
<p>
A young man, a few yards ahead of them, turned.
As his gaze rested upon the two girls he stopped,
and lifted his cap.
</p>
<p>
Shirley approached quickly and extended her
hand, which Dick grasped warmly. Then he shook
hands with Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“It’s good to see you again,” he said warmly.
</p>
<p>
“And I’m glad to see you again,” said Shirley.
“What are you doing in Louisville?”
</p>
<p>
“I’m working here,” was the reply. “I’m office
boy in one of the large newspaper offices. Some
day,” he added, “I hope to be a reporter.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_217'></a>217</span>
</p>
<p>
“And I am sure it will not be long before you
are,” declared Shirley. “How is it that you are not
working this afternoon?”
</p>
<p>
“I work all night,” was the reply. “I go to
work at six o’clock.”
</p>
<p>
“Have you seen anything of Jones?” demanded
the girl, after some further talk.
</p>
<p>
“I thought I saw him on the street the other
day,” was the reply, “but I am not sure. However,
I suppose he is here. Have you had any
more trouble with him?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” replied Shirley, and told him everything
that had happened since Dick had left them.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Dick, “I should advise that Gabriel
be carefully guarded. Jones is a desperate man.
There is no telling what he may attempt.”
</p>
<p>
“I do not believe he will be able to do much damage
now,” declared Shirley. “Leonard is with Gabriel
all the time.”
</p>
<p>
“I wouldn’t take any chances.”
</p>
<p>
“We won’t.”
</p>
<p>
“And you say Jimmy will be in condition to
ride?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“Good; but I must be leaving you now. I hope
I shall see you again before you return home,” and
lifting his hat, Dick turned away.
</p>
<p>
“Will you go to the Derby with us?” Shirley
called after him.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_218'></a>218</span>
</p>
<p>
Dick hesitated a moment before replying.
</p>
<p>
“I shall be glad to,” he said at length.
</p>
<p>
“Then come to the hotel at 10 o’clock Monday
morning,” said Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll be there,” said the boy, and with another
bow he was gone.
</p>
<p>
Shirley and Mabel returned to the hotel.
</p>
<p>
“How is everything at the track, Dad?” asked
Shirley when her father came in a few moments
later.
</p>
<p>
“First rate.”
</p>
<p>
“Have there been any attempts to injure Gabriel?”
</p>
<p>
“No. Leonard thought he caught sight of Jones
out there yesterday, but he is not sure. I think he
must be mistaken. I reckon we are through with
Jones.”
</p>
<p>
“I hope so,” replied both girls.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll take you all out to-morrow and let you have
a look at Gabriel,” said Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“What are we going to do to-night?” asked Shirley.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing smiled at her.
</p>
<p>
“What would my little girl like to do?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I would like to go to the theater, but
there is no one to leave with Jimmy.”
</p>
<p>
“I’ll stay behind, and you can go with Ashton,”
declared Mr. Willing.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_219'></a>219</span>
</p>
<p>
And this plan, after some discussion, was followed.
</p>
<p>
It was late when the three returned to the hotel,
and knowing that they must be up early in the morning,
they all went to bed immediately.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t you think Jimmy should have a little exercise,
Dad?” asked Shirley, just before telling her
father good-night.
</p>
<p>
“I had thought of that,” was the reply. “If he
is feeling strong enough to-morrow afternoon, I
shall take him out to the track for a few minutes.
Besides, he should have a look at the course before
the race.”
</p>
<p>
“He is certainly getting along splendidly,” declared
Shirley. “I feel sure a little outing will do
him good.”
</p>
<p>
Jimmy, who had overheard this conversation,
smiled.
</p>
<p>
“I should like to see Gabriel,” he said quietly.
“I want to tell him that we must win this race.”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, he knows that now, I’m sure,” said Shirley
with a laugh. “I’ve told him all about it myself.”
</p>
<p>
“Then there is nothing to be feared,” said Jimmy.
“Gabriel will do anything for you.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, young people,” said Mr. Willing, “you
have talked enough. It’s time for you to get to
bed.”
</p>
<p>
And soon all were sleeping soundly.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_220'></a>220</span><a name='chXXVII' id='chXXVII'></a>CHAPTER XXVII.—MABEL PROVES HER COURAGE.</h2>
<p>
The following afternoon, in the touring car, the
entire Willing party was driven to the track. They
went immediately to Gabriel’s quarters in the training
field, where, after a sharp knock upon the door,
Leonard admitted them.
</p>
<p>
“Anything new?” asked Mr. Willing, as he entered.
</p>
<p>
“Not a thing,” replied Leonard with a smile.
“Everything’s quiet and serene.”
</p>
<p>
“Good. I’ve brought you some visitors.”
</p>
<p>
Leonard stepped back, and Shirley, Mabel, Mr.
Ashton and Jimmy stepped inside.
</p>
<p>
Although somewhat weak and a trifle pale Jimmy
seemed to be almost himself again. He walked
slowly, but said he was feeling splendidly.
</p>
<p>
“Where is Gabriel?” he asked.
</p>
<p>
Leonard pointed and Jimmy hurried forward as
fast as his weakened condition would permit.
</p>
<p>
Gabriel received him with a whinny of delight,
and throwing his arms about the big black horse’s
neck, Jimmy talked to him long and lovingly.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_221'></a>221</span>
</p>
<p>
Then he rejoined the others.
</p>
<p>
“Gabriel has promised he will win the race,” Jimmy
whispered to Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Then it is just as good as won,” declared the
girl.
</p>
<p>
“Jimmy,” called Mr. Willing at that moment,
“would you like to have a look at the course?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir,” replied the boy, and went forward.
</p>
<p>
“I’m going too,” declared Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“And I,” said Ashton.
</p>
<p>
“I’d like to have a look myself,” said Leonard.
“I haven’t had a chance to get out and look about
since I have been here.”
</p>
<p>
“But who will stay with Gabriel?” asked Mr.
Willing.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll stay,” Mabel volunteered.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing hesitated for a moment, then consented.
</p>
<p>
“I think it will be all right for a few minutes,” he
said.
</p>
<p>
“Mabel, don’t go too near Gabriel,” said Shirley.
“He might not like it.”
</p>
<p>
“Don’t worry,” was the laughing rejoinder. “I
won’t go in his stall. I know as well as you do
that he wouldn’t permit any one but you and Jimmy
in there.”
</p>
<p>
Mabel sat down in a chair to await the return of
the others, who now went out the door.
</p>
<p>
Gabriel, with his head out of his stall door, eyed
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_222'></a>222</span>
the girl searchingly; and looking up suddenly, Mabel
caught his eye and smiled. Gabriel’s ears
twitched, and he didn’t seem half as ferocious as
usual.
</p>
<p>
“Strange,” mused Mabel. “He never let me get
that close to him before.”
</p>
<p>
At that moment the door behind her slammed
with a bang. Turning quickly Mabel started back
with a cry. She was face to face with Jones.
</p>
<p>
“So,” said Jones with a sneering smile, “we meet
again! Now you listen to me, and do as I say. I
haven’t much time and I don’t want to waste any.
You get out of here just as fast as you can. Do
you hear?”
</p>
<p>
Mabel made no reply, but backed toward Gabriel’s
stall. Jones took a step forward.
</p>
<p>
“Do you hear me?” he cried angrily.
</p>
<p>
Mabel was badly frightened, but tried not to
show it.
</p>
<p>
Raising her hand, she pointed to the door.
</p>
<p>
“Leave here at once,” she commanded. “Mr.
Willing will be back here in a few minutes and he
will attend to you.”
</p>
<p>
Jones smiled again.
</p>
<p>
“I have plenty of time to do what I came for,”
he said. “Get away from that stall.”
</p>
<p>
Mabel only shrunk back closer.
</p>
<p>
Gabriel, his head protruding from his stall,
watched this scene with dilated eyes and quivering
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_223'></a>223</span>
nostrils. He stamped angrily, and uttered several
snorts.
</p>
<p>
As Jones took another step forward, Mabel advanced,
as though to meet him. Then, as Jones
halted, she put her hand behind her and opened the
catch to Gabriel’s stall. Quickly she pushed the door
back, and leaping suddenly inside, she closed it
again.
</p>
<p>
Jones, with a cry of rage, leaped forward, but as
he did so Gabriel tossed his head angrily and the
man stepped back in fear.
</p>
<p>
“Now,” said Mabel quietly, “unless you leave here
immediately I shall open this door and let Gabriel at
you.”
</p>
<p>
“You wouldn’t dare,” sneered Jones.
</p>
<p>
He glanced quickly about him, his face alight with
an evil smile. He took a few steps back, and stooping,
came up with a gun in his hands.
</p>
<p>
“You had better get down out of the way,” he
said. “I’ll take a shot at Gabriel with this. It won’t
kill him, but I guess it will do enough damage to
keep him out of the race.”
</p>
<p>
He brought the revolver to his shoulder and took
deliberate aim.
</p>
<p>
“Get down quick!” he commanded. “You might
get hurt!”
</p>
<p>
Mabel glanced about her.
</p>
<p>
Hanging on a nail from the side of the stall she
saw a curry comb and brush. With a quick leap she
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_224'></a>224</span>
seized them, and then, running forward, she threw
them with all her strength.
</p>
<p>
Her aim was perfect, and true to its mark the
heavy brush shot forward, catching Jones squarely
in the forehead.
</p>
<p>
Jones staggered back and dropped his weapon.
</p>
<p>
But the blow was not hard enough to knock him
down, and he sprang up again with a cry of rage
and stooped to pick up the gun.
</p>
<p>
At that instant Mabel opened wide Gabriel’s stall.
</p>
<p>
With an almost human cry, Gabriel, who had been
jumping about angrily, charged through the door
straight at Jones. The latter saw him coming, and
leaped aside, and Gabriel, striking out with his forefeet,
missed.
</p>
<p>
Jones ran quickly toward the door and laid hold
of the knob.
</p>
<p>
But before he could turn it the horse was again
upon him. Snorting, he shoved out his head, and his
teeth met in Jones’ arm.
</p>
<p>
Jones shrieked with the pain of it.
</p>
<p>
Mabel, cowering down in the stall, began to cry.
</p>
<p>
Three times Jones, his arm dripping blood, dashed
around the place with Gabriel in pursuit. The man
was badly frightened, but fear lent fleetness to his
feet. He avoided Gabriel’s teeth narrowly several
times and so far had succeeded in dodging the flying
hoofs.
</p>
<p>
But such a struggle could have but one outcome.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_225'></a>225</span>
</p>
<p>
Suddenly Jones found himself in a corner from
which there was no escape.
</p>
<p>
Gabriel reared high in the air, and his forefeet,
in their descent, struck Jones squarely upon the head.
The man went down in a heap. Gabriel, seeing
his foe prostrate on the floor, stood off and made
ready to leap upon him again.
</p>
<p>
But at that moment the door opened and Jimmy
dashed inside, closely followed by Shirley and the
others.
</p>
<p>
Jimmy leapt for Gabriel’s halter, but missed.
</p>
<p>
Once more the animal reared high in the air,
and his heavy feet would have crushed out Jones’
life had it not been for Shirley’s prompt action.
</p>
<p>
She jumped in front of Gabriel and into the air,
caught him by the halter; then, springing aside, she
drew herself clear of the heavy hoofs just as they
came down with a crash.
</p>
<p>
But she had succeeded in her object, and Gabriel’s
feet missed Jones’ head by the fraction of
an inch.
</p>
<p>
Shirley clung tightly to the halter.
</p>
<p>
For an instant Gabriel’s eyes continued to flame,
but after one quick glance at the girl who had him,
he became quiet. His nostrils still quivered with
anger, but the fire had left his eyes. He stood perfectly
still.
</p>
<p>
Leonard bent over the still form of Jones. Stooping,
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_226'></a>226</span>
he lifted the man’s head to his knee, and at
the same moment Jones’ consciousness returned.
</p>
<p>
He took in the scene before him, and staggered
to his feet, blood covering his face. He glanced
once at the faces about him, and then made for
the door.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing intercepted him.
</p>
<p>
“I have had enough of you. The next time you
cross my path I shall turn you over to the authorities.
I have a notion to do it right now. Get out
of my place, and stay out!”
</p>
<p>
Without a word, Jones slunk to the door and disappeared.
</p>
<p>
“Where is Mabel?” demanded Mr. Ashton in
great anxiety, at this juncture.
</p>
<p>
Mabel was not in sight.
</p>
<p>
All glanced about, and then, from the direction
of Gabriel’s stall, came a faint moan.
</p>
<p>
Shirley ran forward ahead of the others, and
in an instant had her friend’s head in her lap.
</p>
<p>
“Water quick!” she commanded.
</p>
<p>
Leonard hastened forward with a bucket of
water.
</p>
<p>
“Is she hurt?” asked Mr. Ashton, excitedly, pushing
the others away.
</p>
<p>
Shirley made a careful examination of her friend.
</p>
<p>
“No,” she replied. “I don’t see a mark. She
must have fainted.”
</p>
<p>
Mabel moaned again, and a moment later opened
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_227'></a>227</span>
her eyes. Seeing Shirley, she threw her arms
around her friend’s neck and broke into tears again.
The excitement had been too much for her.
</p>
<p>
A few minutes later, however, the flow of tears
ceased and Mabel sat up.
</p>
<p>
“Tell us all about it,” said Shirley, stroking her
chum’s hair.
</p>
<p>
In a few words Mabel complied.
</p>
<p>
“You are a brave girl,” Shirley told her. “Gabriel
might have killed you when you entered his
stall.”
</p>
<p>
“No, he wouldn’t do that,” was Mabel’s reply.
“We had already become friends.”
</p>
<p>
She rose, walked over to the big horse and threw
her arms about his neck. Gabriel submitted to the
caress.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Mr. Willing, “let’s get back to the
hotel.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley led Gabriel back to his stall, and leaving
Leonard once more on guard, the others set out
for their hotel.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_228'></a>228</span><a name='chXXVIII' id='chXXVIII'></a>CHAPTER XXVIII.—THE JOCKEY.</h2>
<p>
It was the day of the great race.
</p>
<p>
Shirley jumped out of bed eagerly, and shook
Mabel, who was still sleeping soundly.
</p>
<p>
“Mabel! Mabel!” she called.
</p>
<p>
Mabel turned sleepily.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“Time to get up,” was the reply. “It’s almost
eight o’clock. This is Derby day.”
</p>
<p>
“So it is,” exclaimed Mabel, awake in an instant
now.
</p>
<p>
She jumped out of bed and the girls dressed
quickly.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing and the others were already up and
dressed when the girls came from their rooms, and
they all went down to breakfast together.
</p>
<p>
It was during the meal that Mr. Willing was
suddenly called by a page.
</p>
<p>
“Gentleman to see you sir,” said the boy.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing excused himself and left the dining
room. He was back in a few minutes, however,
and said to Shirley:
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_229'></a>229</span>
</p>
<p>
“The rest of you will have to come to the track
by yourselves. I have some business to attend to.
I’ll meet you there. I’ll leave the car for you.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Ashton spoke up.
</p>
<p>
“I have some business matters to see about also,”
he said. “I’ll go with you, and Jimmy and the
girls can use the car.”
</p>
<p>
This plan was agreed upon.
</p>
<p>
“By the way, Dad,” said Shirley suddenly, as
her father rose to go, “Dick is going with us.”
</p>
<p>
“Dick!” repeated Mr. Willing. “Who in the
world is Dick?”
</p>
<p>
Shirley explained.
</p>
<p>
“Bring him by all means,” said her father. “I
shall be glad to see him.”
</p>
<p>
At the door he turned.
</p>
<p>
“Meet me in our quarters at 1 o’clock,” he said;
then to Jimmy: “Jimmy, you had better dress here
in the hotel.”
</p>
<p>
Jimmy answered that he would do so, and Mr.
Willing and Mr. Ashton took their departure.
</p>
<p>
The girls waited impatiently for Dick to arrive.
He was announced sharp on the stroke of ten, and
was shown to their suite.
</p>
<p>
“We had better leave here about noon,” he said.
“The crowd will be immense and it may take us
some time to get to the track.”
</p>
<p>
This was agreed upon.
</p>
<p>
The four strolled about the street until eleven
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_230'></a>230</span>
o’clock, when they returned to the hotel for lunch.
</p>
<p>
Jimmy partook of a very light meal, for he wished
to be in exact condition for the race. He left
the table before the others, announcing that he
would go upstairs and change to his jockey clothes.
</p>
<p>
Fifteen minutes later the others followed him.
</p>
<p>
There was not a sound in the room when the
three entered and a peculiar feeling came over Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“Jimmy!” she called suddenly.
</p>
<p>
There was no answer, and again the girl called.
</p>
<p>
Still no answer.
</p>
<p>
“What in the world can be the matter?” asked
the girl anxiously. She turned to Dick. “Will you
go into Jimmy’s room and see what is wrong?” she
asked.
</p>
<p>
Dick disappeared into the other room and the two
girls waited nervously.
</p>
<p>
They heard Dick’s voice raised in an exclamation,
and he came dashing back.
</p>
<p>
“Don’t be alarmed,” he said quietly, as the girls
rose and ran to him.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter?” demanded Shirley, wringing
her hands. “Where is Jimmy?”
</p>
<p>
“He is in there,” said Dick. “But he has been
hurt.”
</p>
<p>
“Hurt!” exclaimed both girls in one voice.
</p>
<p>
“Yes.”
</p>
<p>
“How?”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_231'></a>231</span>
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Dick quietly, “he was struck over the
head with a club.”
</p>
<p>
The girls cried out in dismay.
</p>
<p>
“He is still unconscious,” Dick continued. “I
found him on the floor. I tried to revive him, but
it was no use. I laid him on the bed.”
</p>
<p>
“What are we to do?” said Mabel. “Gabriel will
not be able to run.”
</p>
<p>
“Never mind the race now,” said Shirley. “Let’s
call a doctor for Jimmy. His life is more important
than the race.”
</p>
<p>
She stepped quickly to the telephone and summoned
the hotel physician. Then all went into
Jimmy.
</p>
<p>
The lad had not had time to change into his jockey
costume. Apparently he had been struck down the
moment he entered the room.
</p>
<p>
As Shirley bent over him, he moved restlessly
and opened his eyes. He saw Shirley, and smiled
slightly.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter, Jimmy?” asked the girl
gently. “How did it happen?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know,” came the weak reply. “Something
hit me as I stepped in the door.”
</p>
<p>
Dick came up to the bed at this point. In his
hand he held a short cudgel.
</p>
<p>
“Here is the weapon,” he said quietly.
</p>
<p>
“But who did it?” asked Shirley.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_232'></a>232</span>
</p>
<p>
“It’s some of Jones’ work, I should say,” said
Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“Of course,” agreed Dick.
</p>
<p>
At this moment Jimmy tried to sit up.
</p>
<p>
“What time is it?” he asked in a feeble voice.
</p>
<p>
Shirley looked at her watch.
</p>
<p>
“Quarter after twelve,” she said.
</p>
<p>
“Then I must get up,” declared Jimmy. “I must
get to the track.”
</p>
<p>
A knock sounded at the door, and the hotel physician
entered. He made a quick examination.
</p>
<p>
“Can I ride in the Derby this afternoon?” asked
Jimmy eagerly.
</p>
<p>
The doctor shook his head.
</p>
<p>
“You’ll stay in bed for a week,” he said quietly.
</p>
<p>
“But I must get to the track,” said Jimmy. “Mr.
Willing is depending on me! I must go.”
</p>
<p>
“It is impossible,” said the physician.
</p>
<p>
“Then what shall we do?” cried the boy. “Who
will ride Gabriel?”
</p>
<p>
“I guess Gabriel will not run,” said the physician
quietly.
</p>
<p>
“But he will,” cried Shirley, “and he shall win
too.”
</p>
<p>
The others looked at the girl in surprise.
</p>
<p>
“What do you mean?” demanded Mabel.
</p>
<p>
The girl took a long breath, then said quietly:
</p>
<p>
“I will ride him!”
</p>
<p>
The others uttered exclamations of surprise.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_233'></a>233</span>
</p>
<p>
“But you can’t, Shirley,” protested Mabel.
</p>
<p>
“But I will,” came the firm reply.
</p>
<p>
“Your father would never hear of such a thing.”
</p>
<p>
“He doesn’t need to know anything about it.
But the rest of you must help me. I’ll dress here
in Jimmy’s clothes. No one will know the difference.
I have played Jimmy once and I can do it
again. But you, Mabel, and you, Dick, must keep
between me and father as much as possible.”
</p>
<p>
“What will your father say when he fails to see
you at the track? He will want to know what has
become of you.”
</p>
<p>
“Then you must tell him something that will satisfy
him for the time.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley looked at her watch again.
</p>
<p>
“Twenty minutes past twelve. I shall have to
hurry,” she said.
</p>
<p>
Quickly she went to Jimmy’s trunk and pulled
forth his jockey clothes. Then she hastened to her
own room.
</p>
<p>
The others waited her return without a word.
</p>
<p>
“How do I look?” came a voice from the doorway
at last.
</p>
<p>
Jimmy, Dick, Mabel and the doctor took one
look and cried out in surprise.
</p>
<p>
“Great Scott! I wouldn’t have believed it possible,”
declared the physician.
</p>
<p>
In her red and blue costume—the Willing colors—Shirley
indeed made a pretty picture. Her cap
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_234'></a>234</span>
was pulled down well over her face and her thick
hair was coiled up under it. In her hand she held
Jimmy’s short whip.
</p>
<p>
“Will I do?” she asked.
</p>
<p>
“You look enough like this lad to be his twin,”
said the physician quietly. “You’ll do.”
</p>
<p>
“We must hurry,” declared Shirley. “Ready,
Mabel? Ready, Dick?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” they answered.
</p>
<p>
Shirley approached Jimmy.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll try not to lose your reputation,” she said
gently. “I’ll do the best I know how, and I am
sure that Gabriel will try for me.”
</p>
<p>
“There is no doubt about that,” replied Jimmy.
“With you on Gabriel’s back, I feel more certain
of the outcome of the race than I would if I were
there myself.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley held out her hand and the lad grasped it
warmly.
</p>
<p>
“Be very careful,” he warned her. “Watch the
others closely. They will probably try some crookedness,
for they must all be in it together. Keep
as clear of the field as possible, and let Gabriel run
his own race.”
</p>
<p>
“I shall remember,” said Shirley. “And now
good-bye.”
</p>
<p>
She pressed Jimmy’s hand gently and stepped toward
the door. The physician stopped her.
</p>
<p>
“I want to say,” he declared, “that you are the
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_235'></a>235</span>
bravest girl I have ever seen. I am sure that you
will win.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, doctor,” replied Shirley with a
slight smile. “Take good care of Jimmy.”
</p>
<p>
“I shall stay right here until you return,” said
the doctor, knowing this would make Shirley less
worried about Jimmy during her absence.
</p>
<p>
Shirley nodded and passed out of the room ahead
of her friends.
</p>
<p>
The Willing touring car stood in front of the
hotel, and the chauffeur—a man Mr. Willing had
hired because he knew the town—was waiting.
</p>
<p>
Shirley stood aside while Mabel and Dick climbed
in, and then she got in after them.
</p>
<p>
“To the race track,” she commanded, “and
hurry.”
</p>
<p>
Mabel looked at her watch.
</p>
<p>
“Twenty-five minutes to one,” she remarked.
</p>
<p>
“Good,” replied Shirley. “We’ll make it.”
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_236'></a>236</span><a name='chXXIX' id='chXXIX'></a>CHAPTER XXIX.—THE DERBY.</h2>
<p>
All Louisville, it seemed, was at the Derby that
day.
</p>
<p>
From early in the morning until after the races
started, crowds continued to pour into the grandstand
and overflow into the paddock. Thousands
of women, in brilliant costumes, gave a picturesque
touch to the scene. It was indeed a gala day.
</p>
<p>
Gaily decked in bright colors, the grandstand
presented an attractive appearance. Everywhere
happiness and light-heartedness prevailed. It was
the day of the year when Louisville gave itself over
to frolic.
</p>
<p>
The races were scheduled to start at 2 o’clock,
and as the winner of the first event flashed under
the wire the crowd cheered. But in spite of these
first events—good races though they were—the
crowd waited impatiently for the superb horses that
were to fight for the Derby.
</p>
<p>
It was a few minutes after 1 o’clock when Shirley,
Mabel and Dick reached the track, and hurried
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_237'></a>237</span>
to the Willing quarters. Mr. Willing was pacing
up and down anxiously when they appeared, and
Mr. Ashton and Leonard were beside him.
</p>
<p>
Gabriel, all ready for the race, stood quietly
nearby.
</p>
<p>
“Well, here you are at last,” said Mr. Willing as
the three approached them. “Where is Shirley?”
</p>
<p>
“Oh, she will be here soon,” said Mabel. “Don’t
worry about her. Let me introduce Dick Stanley,
Mr. Willing, the boy who came so nobly to our
aid.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing extended his hand and the lad
grasped it.
</p>
<p>
“I am glad to know you,” said the former. “Allow
me to thank you for the service you rendered
me.”
</p>
<p>
“It was nothing,” said Dick and stepped back.
</p>
<p>
All this time Shirley had contrived to keep her
back to her father, for she was well aware that if
he should recognize her he would not permit her
to ride.
</p>
<p>
At that moment Leonard approached.
</p>
<p>
He looked sharply at the supposed jockey, and
then stepped back suddenly and opened his mouth
to speak.
</p>
<p>
Shirley laid a finger to her lips in a quick gesture,
and Leonard closed his mouth without a word.
Nevertheless he continued to stare at her in amazement.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_238'></a>238</span>
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing, not suspecting anything of this
nature, did not glance closely at the jockey, which
was fortunate. Shirley kept her cap pulled well
down, and thus avoided detection.
</p>
<p>
“The Derby will be called a few minutes after
three,” said Mr. Willing. “Are you ready, Jimmy?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir,” replied Shirley, imitating Jimmy’s
voice as nearly as she could.
</p>
<p>
“Are you feeling perfectly fit?”
</p>
<p>
“Yes, sir.”
</p>
<p>
“Good.”
</p>
<p>
He led the way to the scales, where Shirley was
weighed.
</p>
<p>
“Ninety-eight,” said Mr. Willing, stepping back.
“Good.”
</p>
<p>
The time came at last, and Shirley, seated firmly
upon Gabriel’s back, rode slowly toward the barrier.
Mr. Willing followed, giving last advice.
</p>
<p>
“Get away as well as you can,” he told her, “and
give Gabriel his head. Under no circumstances use
the whip. Let Gabriel run his own race.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley nodded her understanding of these orders,
but made no reply. Mr. Willing stepped back
and joined the others.
</p>
<p>
“I wonder where Shirley is?” he said.
</p>
<p>
“Oh, perhaps she stopped to talk to some one,”
said Mabel quietly.
</p>
<p>
“Well, I guess she is safe enough,” said Mr.
Willing. “Come.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_239'></a>239</span>
</p>
<p>
He led the way to the paddock and the others
followed.
</p>
<p>
After some trouble they succeeded in gaining advantageous
places, and turned their eyes toward the
track. And at that moment a familiar voice near
Mabel said:
</p>
<p>
“Great Scott! Gabriel is going to run.”
</p>
<p>
Mabel turned and glanced at the speaker. It was
Jones, and even as Mabel looked he turned upon
the man beside him.
</p>
<p>
“I thought you told me you had fixed the jockey!”
he exclaimed.
</p>
<p>
“I did,” he declared. “I knocked him cold.”
</p>
<p>
“Then how is it that he is in the race?”
</p>
<p>
“I don’t know. I don’t see how it is possible.
Maybe they got another boy at the last minute.”
</p>
<p>
Jones looked long through his field glasses.
</p>
<p>
“No. It’s the same,” he declared.
</p>
<p>
Again he whirled upon the man angrily.
</p>
<p>
“You have betrayed me,” he cried.
</p>
<p>
“It’s a lie,” said the other.
</p>
<p>
Jones moved toward him, and the other turned
and ran. Jones ran after him.
</p>
<p>
In the meantime, Shirley, hunched almost on
Gabriel’s neck, had ridden forth with the others.
The reins she held in her right hand with the whip,
while with the other she stroked her horse’s neck.
</p>
<p>
“You know me, don’t you, Gabriel?” she whispered.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_240'></a>240</span>
</p>
<p>
Gabriel’s reply was a low whinny.
</p>
<p>
Shirley patted him gently.
</p>
<p>
“And we are going to win, aren’t we, Gabriel?”
</p>
<p>
Again the big horse whinnied.
</p>
<p>
At the post Shirley turned in alongside the others.
Upon her right, nearest the rail outside, was another
great black horse, and Shirley did not need
to be told that this was Jupiter, the animal upon
which the bookmakers were depending to win the
race.
</p>
<p>
He was a wicked-looking brute, and his eyes were
fiery red.
</p>
<p>
“I’ll have to watch him,” thought the girl.
</p>
<p>
She gazed at the other eight entries. Noble-looking
animals they were, the best of Kentucky
stock. She noticed several of the jockeys eyeing
her queerly.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, I shall have to be careful,” she said.
</p>
<p>
The signal to line up at the barrier was given.
</p>
<p>
The high-strung horses moved about nervously.
A pistol cracked, and they were off down the track.
But the starter called them back. It was a false
start.
</p>
<p>
Shirley showed superb horsemanship. She
maneuvered for position as well as any of the rest,
and just before the pistol cracked the second time,
she was but two removed from the inside rail.
</p>
<p>
Next to her, closer to the rail, was Jupiter.
</p>
<p>
“They’re off!”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_241'></a>241</span>
</p>
<p>
The cry came from the grandstand, and was followed
by a prolonged cheer.
</p>
<p>
Shirley found herself slightly behind the leaders
at the first jump, but she did not worry. She knew
what Gabriel could do, and she was perfectly satisfied
with her position.
</p>
<p>
In a bunch the field swept down the track. Shirley
found herself wedged in between Jupiter and a
powerful sorrel on her other side. In this way they
continued for the first half-mile.
</p>
<p>
Gradually the three leaders, Jupiter, Gabriel and
the big sorrel forged ahead of the field, and at the
three-quarter mark the sorrel dropped behind. He
was unable to keep up the terrific pace.
</p>
<p>
Jupiter was still running slightly ahead and going
easily. Not once had his jockey used his whip
or urged him to greater effort. Nor had there as
yet been any attempt at unfairness.
</p>
<p>
Shirley held a tight rein upon Gabriel, and the
animal had not yet let himself out. In spite of her
father’s instructions, Shirley was riding her own
race. She believed that she knew more about Gabriel
than either her father or Jimmy.
</p>
<p>
And now, with the finish a quarter of a mile
ahead, Shirley let Gabriel out slightly, and he came
up on even terms with Jupiter in a few strides.
</p>
<p>
Then Jupiter’s rider got busy. He loosened his
reins and began to coax. But Gabriel remained on
even terms. Jupiter’s jockey stopped coaxing and
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_242'></a>242</span>
began to ply his whip, and at the first smart blow,
Jupiter leaped ahead.
</p>
<p>
Shirley let Gabriel out another notch, and then
another, and once more the two big black horses
were neck and neck. Try as he would, Jupiter
could not shake Gabriel off.
</p>
<p>
Glancing ahead, Shirley saw that the finish was
close in front. The crowd had gone wild. With
the horses rushing for the wire, bedlam had broken
loose. Flags and pennants waved and men and
women shouted hoarsely.
</p>
<p>
But of this Shirley neither heard nor saw anything.
Her eyes were fixed upon the wire and she
knew nothing but that Gabriel must be the first
under it.
</p>
<p>
And now, as the two great horses thundered down
to the finish, Shirley leaned forward on Gabriel’s
neck and whispered to him. The noble animal responded,
and with a tremendous leap forged ahead
of his rival.
</p>
<p>
At the same moment, Jupiter’s rider, realizing
that he could not overtake his opponent, lashed out
with his whip.
</p>
<p>
The blow caught Shirley squarely across the face,
and she reeled, and for a moment Gabriel was almost
thrown off his stride. But the gallant horse
recovered quickly, and with a last desperate effort,
leaped forward under the wire—a winner by a
neck.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_243'></a>243</span>
</p>
<p>
Shirley, in great pain, still had the presence of
mind to pull Gabriel in, and sick and faint, she
headed him quickly for the Willing stable.
</p>
<p>
But Mr. Willing and the others, as well as the
rest of the crowd, had seen the cowardly act, and
a great cry of anger rose in the air. Mr. Willing
made for his stable at top speed, the others following.
</p>
<p>
At his stable, Gabriel stopped.
</p>
<p>
Shirley swayed in the saddle and toppled over;
and Mr. Willing, running up at that moment, arrived
just in time to catch her in his arms.
</p>
<p>
Gently he laid her on the ground. Her cap fell
from her head, and her long hair came tumbling
down.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing stood still in his surprise.
</p>
<p>
“Shirley!” he cried, and gathered her up in his
arms.
</p>
<h2><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_244'></a>244</span><a name='chXXX' id='chXXX'></a>CHAPTER XXX.—THE PUNISHMENT OF JONES.</h2>
<p>
“Shirley!” cried Mr. Willing again, and looked
at his daughter in alarm.
</p>
<p>
At this moment Mabel and Leonard came running
up, having outdistanced Mr. Ashton.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing turned to them quickly.
</p>
<p>
“Dr. Thompson is back there in the paddock,”
he said, pointing. “Hurry! and see if you can find
him.”
</p>
<p>
Mabel hurried away in response to this command.
She was fortunate enough to find the physician
after a brief search, and she conducted him back
to where Mr. Willing still held Shirley in his arms.
</p>
<p>
The doctor laid her gently on the soft ground
and bent over her.
</p>
<p>
“Nothing serious,” he said rising at last. “She
seems to have fainted more because of the excitement
than anything else. She’ll come to presently.”
</p>
<p>
Dr. Thompson proved a good prophet. Five
minutes later Shirley opened her eyes and smiled
up at her father.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_245'></a>245</span>
</p>
<p>
“Did we win?” she asked somewhat feebly.
</p>
<p>
“Yes, you won,” replied Mr. Willing in a low
voice. “But, Shirley, why did you do it?”
</p>
<p>
“Somebody had to do it, Dad,” was the reply.
“I knew I was the only one that could ride Gabriel
outside of Jimmy.”
</p>
<p>
“But I would rather have had Gabriel scratched
than to have you take such a risk,” said Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“I know that. That’s why I didn’t tell you.”
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing turned to Mabel, as Shirley fell back,
tired out, and closed her eyes.
</p>
<p>
“What is the matter with Jimmy?” he demanded.
</p>
<p>
Mabel explained.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing grew very angry.
</p>
<p>
“I have had enough of this,” he declared. “I
shall notify the police as soon as we get back down
town. I’ll see that Jones answers for his actions.
I’ll prosecute him to the full extent of the law.”
</p>
<p>
Half an hour later, with Shirley lying in the
rear seat, the car, also bearing Mr. Willing, Mr.
Ashton, Dick, Mabel and Leonard, was speeding
down town.
</p>
<p>
By the time it reached the hotel Shirley had so
far recovered that she was able to make her way
to their apartments unassisted. True to his promise,
the hotel physician had remained with Jimmy all
this time.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_246'></a>246</span>
</p>
<p>
“And did you win the race?” was his first question,
as Shirley entered the room.
</p>
<p>
“Yes,” was the girl’s smiling rejoinder. “We
won.”
</p>
<p>
“Good,” cried the physician. He rose from his
chair. “You have no further need of me,” he said,
“I shall be going.”
</p>
<p>
He bowed and made his departure.
</p>
<p>
After a few words with Jimmy, Mr. Willing announced
his intention of going immediately to the
police station and swearing out a warrant against
Jones. Shirley tried to turn him from his purpose,
but in vain. Then she declared that she would go
with him.
</p>
<p>
All Mr. Willing’s objections went for naught, so
the two started out together. As they were driving
along the street, Shirley cried out suddenly and
caught her father by the arm.
</p>
<p>
“What’s the matter now?” he demanded.
</p>
<p>
“There is Jones,” said Shirley, pointing to the
sidewalk.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing followed the direction of her finger.
Sure enough, there was Jones, deep in conversation
with another man.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing ordered the chauffeur to stop the
car, and he leaped out.
</p>
<p>
“What are you going to do, Dad?” called Shirley,
in alarm.
</p>
<p>
Mr. Willing vouchsafed no reply.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_247'></a>247</span>
</p>
<p>
He walked directly up to Jones, who at that moment
was looking the other way. He took him
by the arm and swung him about, so that they stood
face to face.
</p>
<p>
As Jones, greatly surprised, would have stepped
back, Mr. Willing raised one arm, and deliberately
slapped the man across the face.
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps that will teach you, sir,” he exclaimed,
“to let me and mine alone in the future.”
</p>
<p>
Jones was no coward. He wiped a few drops
of blood from his lips, and stepping suddenly forward,
aimed a heavy blow at Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
But the latter, in spite of his age, was still agile
and strong. He sprang to one side, and avoided the
blow, but then, stepping in close, sent his fist into
the other’s face with all his power.
</p>
<p>
Jones struck the sidewalk like a log. His companion
took to his heels.
</p>
<p>
A crowd, attracted by the scuffle, began to gather.
</p>
<p>
Presently Jones pulled himself together and
scrambled to his feet. Mr. Willing still stood with
clenched fists and set lips.
</p>
<p>
“Have you had enough?” he asked. “Or shall
I give you another dose?”
</p>
<p>
For one moment it seemed that Jones would renew
the fight; but after a look at the rapidly gathering
crowd, he turned and walked away.
</p>
<p>
“Three cheers for the old boy,” shouted a youngster
in the crowd.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_248'></a>248</span>
</p>
<p>
The cheers were given with a will.
</p>
<p>
At that moment a hand was laid on Mr. Willing’s
shoulder. The latter turned to face a policeman.
</p>
<p>
“You are under arrest,” said the officer. “Come
with me.”
</p>
<p>
In vain Mr. Willing protested. The officer was
firm. Finally Mr. Willing consented to go without
trouble.
</p>
<p>
“If you’ll step into my car, I’ll drive you to the
station,” he said.
</p>
<p>
The policeman accepted this offer.
</p>
<p>
Shirley, perceiving her father in the hands of the
law, was frightened. Mr. Willing reassured her,
however, when he stepped into the car, and ordered
the chauffeur to drive to police headquarters.
</p>
<p>
As they continued down the street, the crowd
gave three more ringing cheers. Mr. Willing was
forced to smile.
</p>
<p>
At the police station Mr. Willing had little difficulty
explaining matters satisfactorily to the sergeant,
and he was allowed to go.
</p>
<p>
“You did perfectly right,” declared the old sergeant.
</p>
<p>
He shook hands with Mr. Willing and his daughter,
and wished them good luck. The latter then
returned to their hotel.
</p>
<p>
“I guess that was enough punishment for Jones,”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_249'></a>249</span>
said Mr. Willing cheerfully in relating the occurrence
to Mr. Ashton a short time later.
</p>
<p>
“Indeed it was,” was the reply, “and it also saved
you a lot of court trouble and notoriety.”
</p>
<p>
“Right you are,” agreed Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
Two days longer the party stayed in Louisville,
and then set out for home. Jimmy’s injuries were
getting along nicely and no serious results were anticipated.
The mark on Shirley’s face, caused by
the blow of the whip, was also rapidly disappearing.
</p>
<p>
An hour before it was time for their train to
leave, Dick was announced. Shirley welcomed him
warmly, as did Mr. Willing.
</p>
<p>
“My daughter has told me of you,” said the latter,
“and I should be glad to have you go home with
us. I can offer you work on my farm.”
</p>
<p>
“Thank you, sir,” replied Dick, “but, for the
present, I prefer to remain here.”
</p>
<p>
“But,” protested Mr. Willing, “surely you have
not such a remunerative place here that makes you
so anxious to stay?”
</p>
<p>
“No, sir. I am only an office boy in a big newspaper
office, but some of these days, sir, I hope to
climb. Within the year I expect to be on the reportorial
staff of the <em>Star</em>.”
</p>
<p>
“Well, you know your own mind best. However,
I should be pleased to have you go with us.”
</p>
<p>
“And I should be pleased to go, sir.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_250'></a>250</span>
</p>
<p>
“Perhaps he will come and spend Christmas with
us,” suggested Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“I certainly shall, if it is possible,” replied the lad.
“But you know, Miss Willing, a newspaper man
works holidays as well as others. However, it
may be that I can get off.”
</p>
<p>
“You must get away,” declared Shirley. “We
shall expect you.”
</p>
<p>
“I will do my best,” the lad promised.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Mr. Willing, “we shall have to be
getting down toward the station. It is getting late.”
</p>
<p>
Dick shook hands all around and bowed himself
out
</p>
<p>
“A very manly and likeable boy,” said Mr. Willing,
as he disappeared through the door.
</p>
<p>
“Indeed he is,” replied Shirley.
</p>
<p>
An hour later the party was speeding along in the
direction of Lexington.
</p>
<p>
Gabriel already had been shipped home, and they
knew that they would find him there, safe and
sound, when they returned. Shirley had not seen
the horse since just after the race, and was anxious
to call upon him in his own home.
</p>
<p>
So, the first thing after their arrival at the farm,
she, Mabel, Leonard and Jimmy made straight for
Gabriel’s stall. The racehorse received them with
whinnies of joy.
</p>
<p>
“Good old Gabriel,” said Shirley, dashing into the
stall and throwing her arms around the animal’s
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_251'></a>251</span>
neck. “I knew you would win for us. And think
what you have accomplished. You have saved the
farm for Dad and me.”
</p>
<p>
The others now approached, and Gabriel put
aside his customary unfriendliness toward strangers,
and allowed all to pat him to their hearts’ content.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Leonard, “I have had the time of
my life here, and I am sorry to say that I shall
have to leave you to-morrow.”
</p>
<p>
“Leave us?” exclaimed Shirley in surprise.
</p>
<p>
“Yes. I start home to-morrow night.”
</p>
<p>
Both girls heard this piece of news with regret,
for both had become greatly attached to young
Wolfe.
</p>
<p>
At this juncture Jimmy, who was now able to
get around, turned to Shirley.
</p>
<p>
“And had it not been for you, Miss Shirley,” he
said seriously, “there is no telling what might have
happened to me. Certainly you saved me from myself.”
</p>
<p>
Shirley extended her hand, and the boy grasped
it warmly.
</p>
<p>
“I could never have rested in peace had you
gone away, Jimmy Smith,” she said with a faint
smile. “I shall never forget that it was a few
unthoughtful words of mine that almost sent you
on the wrong road.”
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_252'></a>252</span>
</p>
<p>
“Don’t talk like that, Miss Shirley,” said Jimmy.
“You know better.”
</p>
<p>
“Of course, she does,” said Leonard and Mabel
in the same voice.
</p>
<p>
“Well,” said Shirley, laughing, “we won’t argue
about it. Everything has turned out all right, and
I am sure that each of us has had a good time.”
</p>
<p>
“Indeed we have,” exclaimed the others.
</p>
<hr class='tb' />
<p>
Here for the time being, we shall take our leave
of the girls, their fathers and friends. But we shall
meet them again before long, in a second volume
entitled “The Blue Grass Seminary Girls’ Christmas
Holidays” or “A Four-Weeks’ Tour with the Glee
Club.”

<span style='font-size:1.2em;font-weight:bold;'>THE CAMP FIRE GIRLS SERIES</span>
</p>
<p>
By HILDEGARD G. FREY.
</p>
<p>
The only series of stories
for Camp Fire Girls endorsed by the officials of the Camp
Fire Girls Organization.
</p>
<p>
PRICE, 40 CENTS PER VOLUME
</p>
<p>
THE CAMP FIRE GIRLS IN THE MAINE WOODS; or,
The Winnebagos go Camping.
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
This lively Camp Fire group and their Guardian go back to Nature in a
camp in the wilds of Maine and pile up more adventures in one summer
than they have had in all their previous vacations put together. Before
the summer is over they have transformed Gladys, the frivolous boarding
school girl, into a genuine Winnebago.
</p>
<p>
THE CAMP FIRE GIRLS AT SCHOOL; or, The Wohelo
Weavers.
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
It is the custom of the Winnebagos to weave the events of their lives
into symbolic bead bands, instead of keeping a diary. All commendatory
doings are worked out in bright colors, but every time the Law of
of the Camp Fire is broken it must be recorded in black. How these
seven live wire girls strive to infuse into their school life the spirit of
Work, Health and Love and yet manage to get into more than their
share of mischief, is told in this story.
</p>
<p>
THE CAMP FIRE GIRLS AT ONOWAY HOUSE; or,
The Magic Garden.
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
Migwan is determined to go to college, and not being strong enough to
work indoors earns the money by raising fruits and vegetables. The
Winnebagos all turn a hand to help the cause along and the “goings-on”
at Onoway House that summer make the foundations shake with
laughter.
</p>
<p>
THE CAMP FIRE GIRLS GO MOTORING; or, Along
the Road That Leads the Way.
</p>
<p style='margin-left: 2em;margin-right: 2em;'>
The Winnebagos take a thousand mile auto trip. The “pinching” of
Nyoda, the fire in the country inn, the runaway girl and the dead-earnest
hare and hound chase combine to make these three weeks the
most exciting the Winnebagos have ever experienced.

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
